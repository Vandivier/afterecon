This article, followingÂ <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/politics-and-government/5-rando-facts-immigration/\"><em>5 Rando Facts on Immigration</em></a> and others, continues a recent trend where I collect a number of writings on a special topic into a single post with summary commentary. The topic for this article is Intelligent Design.

Big Picture:
<ol>
 	<li>Intelligent Design historically grew out of a particular worldview called Creationism, which in itself has a number of flavors.
<ol>
 	<li>Creationism writ large is the idea that God, the Christian God in particular, created mankind.</li>
 	<li>Creationism correlates with strong criticism of classical Darwinism. Some branches of Creationism, including Old Earth Creationism and Theistic Evolution, are compatible with classic Darwinism. Other branches, such as Young Earth Creationism, reject virtually any form of macroevolution. Intelligent Design seems to sit right in the middle: It is compatible with macroevolution and yet it presents strong intellectual criticism and plausible alternatives.</li>
 	<li>it used to make theological arguments? pandas or w/e</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Modern intelligent design does so without appeal to theology of any kind</li>
</ol>
