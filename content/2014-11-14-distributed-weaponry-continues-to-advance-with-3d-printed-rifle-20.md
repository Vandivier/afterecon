As <a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/3d-printed-rifle-2-0-successfully-fires-14-shots/\">reported by infowars.com</a>Â a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"3D printing\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">3D printed</a> <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Rifle\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">rifle</a> has emerged which was tested and sustained 14 shots fired before developing a minor crack. The rifle was apparently 2nd generation. A previous version had cracked after a single successful fire. The creator has plans to distribute an improved version online, resembling a trend set by <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Defense Distributed\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Distributed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Defense Distributed</a> and others which has long been anticipated by anarchists and technology buffs. Videos of the test firing are available in the linked article or on YouTube among other places.
