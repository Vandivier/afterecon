<div id=\"yiv5133321629yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481238965587_11135\">This argument does not actually justify state coercion, but it proves that such coercion is possibly justified in principle and it serves to direct our criticisms toward empiricism if they are going to be valid.</div>
<div>Justified state coercion is possible in principle, it's just not generally likely. This more sophisticated criticism is also more truthful.</div>
<div>In fact it is so unlikely that the counterfactual (unjust coercion) is rationally expected, but it should not be expected with certainty. The inappropriate fostering of such certain expectations is a bit of a tell that an anti-statist is of the naiive or shallow kind rather than the serious kind.</div>
<div>The dominance of the expectation is sufficient to declare the alternative system of the natural, competitively market (not the free market the natural one.)</div>

 	<li id=\"yiv5133321629yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481238965587_10820\">Given that a statement can be true or false, if it is not certainly false then it is possibly true. (Justified argument from ignorance)</li>
 	<li id=\"yiv5133321629yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481238965587_10820\">God's existence is either true by necessity or possibly true or false. It is not false by necessity.</li>
 	<li id=\"yiv5133321629yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481238965587_10820\">Therefore, God at least possibly exists</li>
</ol>
<div>This argument is a genuine argument from ignorance. It is also hardly the only argument for God. Some Christians are accused of believing in God on the grounds of an argument for ignorance. Rather than shrinking from such a point, a good response is: \"On the grounds of perfect ignorance we should believe in God, and all evidence beyond ignorance reinforce this properly basic idea.\"</div>
<div id=\"yiv5133321629yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481238965587_10989\">Given that God at least possibly exists and his rewards are infinite it becomes optimal to genuinely consider his existence true.</div>
