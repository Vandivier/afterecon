This article documents how I went about identifying 20 papers as a starting point in researching the economics of education.

<strong>Motivation</strong>

First, let me give some motivation and background. I'm in the early stages of dissertation writing and my primary interest is in the economics of education. In particular, I am interested in alternative credentials, but I am attempting to broaden to education in general because I have had a tough time locating data for alternative credentials, while at the same time I have been encouraged in the obvious ability to publish on certain more traditional topics including the use of vouchers.

As an economist, I am looking for ways to improve education outcomes. This may mean increasing investment where the ROI is positive, and it may mean implementing austerity to combat waste. In determining ROI, I need to investigate the education literature to come up with reasonable measures of education and factors of performance among other things. I also want to look at the extant economic literature to identify common approaches, measures, and conclusions. Perhaps most of all, I am looking into both sets of literature to find interesting open questions.

<strong>Approach</strong>

My approach is to identify at least 5 papers in each of these categories:
<ol>
 	<li>Recent papers in top journals of education</li>
 	<li>Highly regarded education papers, in terms of cites/year, regardless of journal or time</li>
 	<li>Recent papers in top economics journals regarding education</li>
 	<li>Highly regarded papers in the economics of education, in terms of cites/year, regardless of journal or time</li>
</ol>
These 20 papers are a starting point. They will help me identify certain items which I will continue to research after. These items include:
<ol>
 	<li>Keywords</li>
 	<li>Author names</li>
 	<li>Research designs</li>
 	<li>Open and closed questions</li>
 	<li>Interesting prior papers, via citations. In particular, citations in common.</li>
</ol>
