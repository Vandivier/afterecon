<p>I've just completed reading through the Book of Mormon, and this article kicks off a series of articles that will collectively describe both some of the things I like about Mormonism and also some of the issues I have with it. This article begins with five reasons, but this list is hardly comprehensive. It's simply a starting point.</p>

<p><strong>I. A Note on Non-LDS Mormonism</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_denominations_in_the_Latter_Day_Saint_movement&amp;oldid=1036536044\">Over ninety-eight percent of Mormons are members of the LDS Church</a>, and more than one and a half percent of Mormons are members of the RLDS Church. For these reasons, I will now briefly make two important notes about the RLDS Church. In later sections, I will then equivocate between the LDS Church and Mormonism:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>The RLDS Church is trinity-affirming and accepts a non-literal reading of the Book of Mormon and other Mormon revelations. As such, it might be easier to fold back in with traditional Christianity.</li><li>The RLDS Church is affirmed by Joseph Smith III, which gives this branch a strong claim to scriptural authenticity under the same Mormon scriptures that LDS members claim affirm Joseph Smith II.</li></ol>

<p><strong>II. Ironmanning Christianity</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the sake of this article, I will be optimizing with respect to Pascal's Wager, which can be done by selecting a subset of Christian denominations and doctrines to defend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specifically, I'm defending a roughly Sola Fide form of Christianity, which seems <a href=\"http://thegospelcoalition.org/article/new-survey-finds-majority-of-protestants-are-not-protestant/\">accepted by about half of protestants</a>. Despite the poll data, I believe that most protestants, as well as many Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox believers, would come to agree with my point here within minutes of discussing the edge case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Penitent_thief&amp;oldid=1039196168\">the Penitent Thief</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to affirming salvation by faith alone, the iron-manned form of Christianity used in this comparison will also affirm <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eternal_security&amp;oldid=1040067136\">Eternal Security</a>. We see that these two doctrines combine to make winning Pascal's Wager rather straightforward under this kind of Iron Christianity.</p>

<p><strong>III. Issues with LDS Mormonism</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>Mormonism is a strict loser to Protestant Christianity under Pascal's Wager<ol><li>Note this 2009 message from Apostle Jeffrey Holland, a high member of Mormon leadership, called <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/10/safety-for-the-soul?lang=eng\">Safety for the Soul</a>. It will be reference throughout the issues.</li><li>In this message, Apostle Holland states that the elect can be deceived by the wicked one. This raises at least four issues:<ol><li>In a broad swath of protestant</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Mormon leaders are poor exegetes of their own scripture.</li><li>Mormonism lacks internal consistency.<ol><li>This is true in several ways, but a key issue will be the view of the Trinity:<ol><li>A plain reading of the Book of Mormon agrees with the doctrine of the Trinity. See, for example, </li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Mormonism lacks external validity.<ol><li>Historical and archealogical evidence is a huge problem here. Most of the Book of Mormon describes the Nephites and the Lamanites, among several other groups.</li><li>Cosmology and philosophy are a unique problem for Mormonism.<ol><li>Typically these fields would be to the benefit of the Christian.</li><li>The Kalam Cosmological Argument argues for God's existence from the finite past.</li><li>Unusual among self-identified Christian denominations, Mormonism rejects the finite past and argues for a non-transcendental God with a physical body.</li><li>A seperate but related problem is the infinite regress of gods in Mormonism. In Mormonism, there is no concept of a monadic God as first mover, creator of all, and so on. Mormons regard physical matter as eternal (D&amp;C 93).</li></ol></li><li></li></ol></li><li>Mormon leaders are poor exegetes of their own scripture.</li><li>Mormonism</li></ol>
