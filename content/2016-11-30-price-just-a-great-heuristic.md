This article argues that price is a great heuristic, perhaps even <a href=\"http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/elgeechap/12822_5f5.htm\">the ultimate heuristic</a>, but it is just a great heuristic. It is not impossible to optimize allocation, act rationally, or solve economic problems without price. I argue first from theory and later using empirical data.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Theory</strong></p>

<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">My approach here is to present evidence that some people prefer in-kind gifts to monetary gifts. I will consider such proof in principle as having established that in some cases transactions are efficiently conducted without money.</p>

<ol>
 	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">People value <a href=\"https://www.ezonomics.com/polls/on_your_birthday_would_you_rather_receive_a_surprise_gift_or_an_item_you_ha/\">surprise for it's own sake</a>, so always giving money isn't cool.</li>
 	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">People usually value money over gifts, but not always. Sometimes gifts produce more utility.</li>
 	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">People don't randomly prefer gifts to money. They systematically prefer gifts to money. My Mom doesn't want me to send her money on her birthday. I know this with high confidence for reasons having to do with signals sent outside of the price system.</li>
 	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Sometimes people say they want money more, <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/holiday-rewards-gifts-cash.aspx\">but they demonstrate more reciprocity when receiving a gift</a>.</li>
