This article covers what I believe are the real reasons for the protests in Ukraine.

<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euromaidan&amp;oldid=596340396\">Euromaidan</a>Â is the name the media has given the pro-UN integration movement in Ukraine. As one might predict, the Wikipedia page on the subject has some very good information and also some very bad information. This article is intended to correct the bad information.
