The Economist leans left and NeoKeynesian. So imagine my pleasant surprise when I smelled Pete Leeson on their pages.

<em><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2014/02/our-schumpeter-columnist\">What exactly is an entrepreneur?</a></em> is a pretty dope article on Schumpeterian entrepreneurship, one of the better approaches imho. They cite <a href=\"http://www.ifn.se/wfiles/wp/wp959.pdf\">a solid article by Magnus Henrekson and Tino Sanandaji</a>, but the description of the paper sounded an awful lot like an earlier paper I had heard of involving <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Leeson\">Pete Leeson</a>, a fine antitype of a Keynesian and pro-market ancap.

Sure enough, <a href=\"http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/1/313.short\"><em>Billionaires</em> (2013)</a>, was a reference in the paper. I didn't realize Sanandaji was a contributing author of both papers. I'll have to read some of his stuff.
