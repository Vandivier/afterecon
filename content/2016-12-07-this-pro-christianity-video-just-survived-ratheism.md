Among the many examples of real-world miracles we can point to, I have just discovered another: A pro-Christianity YouTube video which not only survived r/atheism, but it did so while bashing Bill Nye and advocating Creationism!

Here's the video, which basically makes a transcendental argument for God from the existence of numbers. You could call it the argument from math:

Other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transcendental_argument_for_the_existence_of_God&amp;oldid=738437111\">transcendental-type</a> arguments for God include the argument <a href=\"http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-moral-argument-for-god\">from morality</a> and from <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/christian-epistemology-argument-argument/\">argument</a>.

At the time of writing, the video had arrived on the front page of r/all with 5200+ upvotes and still trending.

A key point of surprise is that the comments section isn't full of hate, and atheists/agnostics are even granting the point and upvoting comments in favor:

<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/5grzjm/creationist_scientist_claims_numbers_are_evidence/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5984 size-large\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comments-tag-numbers-atheism-1024x796.png\" alt=\"comments-tag-numbers-atheism\" width=\"605\" height=\"470\" /></a>Click the above image to visit the thread page on Reddit. Interesting point about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis\">simulation hypothesis</a>. I replied to the \"gods all the way up\" as follows:
<blockquote>
<div class=\"usertext-body may-blank-within md-container \">
<div class=\"md\">

It needs to be finitely up, not infinitely up, or else existence never happens. So call the one at the top God.

I think it's helpful for theists to have several diverse arguments anyway in order to build a more robust understanding of God. The numbers thing just establishes a few properties.
