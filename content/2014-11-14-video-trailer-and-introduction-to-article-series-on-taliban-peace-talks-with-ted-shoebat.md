I recently conducted an exciting and insightful interview with <a href=\"http://tedshoebat.com/about/\">Ted Shoebat</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/18/us-peace-talks-taliban-afghanistan\">upcoming Taliban-US peace talks</a>. Ted is an author of multiple books and countless articles. Many of the articles are available at <a href=\"http://shoebat.com/\">shoebat.com</a>. He is an expert on <a title=\"Heresy in Christianity\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy_in_Christianity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Christian heresy</a> and also a political pundit, with an emphasis on <a title=\"Islam\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Islam</a>. Find the interview trailer below:
