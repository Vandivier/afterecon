<a href=\"https://bitbet.us\">BitBet</a> is a well known bitcoin-based betting site. I'm highly pro-prediction market, so in the past I've been a proponent of the site. What I didn't realize is that the betting system is manually administrated by username Znort, which is slang for doing cocaine.

Surprisingly (sarcasm), he has vanished with a ton of money, including thousands of my own dollar equivalent crypto.

Anon and I are now hiring private investigation services including blockchain forensics company <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/\">Chainalysis</a>. The fund is a crypto wallet and your contributions are welcome.

<a href=\"https://bitbet.us/bet/1399/bitcoin-to-top-6000-usd-in-2017/\">As posted by username Investigation_Pool</a>, the btc address is 18CcL2S5F3gDw7WWrxHQgTV3cTXnUP2jea.

Here are some better crypto betting alternatives, which are not centrally administrated, in order of recommendation:
<ol>
 	<li><a href=\"https://augur.net/\">Augur</a>, advised by Eth's creator Vitalik and GMU brainiac Robin Hanson, among others.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://gnosis.pm/\">Gnosis</a></li>
 	<li>Afaik, <a href=\"http://www.bitcoinpredictionmarkets.com/\">everything else is awful</a>.</li>
