<a href=\"https://bitbet.us\">BitBet</a> is a well known bitcoin-based betting site. I'm highly pro-prediction market, so in the past I've been a proponent of the site. What I didn't realize is that the betting system is manually administrated by username Znort, which is slang for doing cocaine.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly (sarcasm), he has vanished with a ton of money, including thousands of my own dollar equivalent crypto.\r\n\r\nAnon and I are now hiring private investigation services including blockchain forensics company <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/\">Chainalysis</a>. The fund is a crypto wallet and your contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bitbet.us/bet/1399/bitcoin-to-top-6000-usd-in-2017/\">As posted by username Investigation_Pool</a>, the btc address is 18CcL2S5F3gDw7WWrxHQgTV3cTXnUP2jea.\r\n\r\nHere are some better crypto betting alternatives, which are not centrally administrated, in order of recommendation:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://augur.net/\">Augur</a>, advised by Eth's creator Vitalik and GMU brainiac Robin Hanson, among others.</li>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://gnosis.pm/\">Gnosis</a></li>\r\n 	<li>Afaik, <a href=\"http://www.bitcoinpredictionmarkets.com/\">everything else is awful</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>
