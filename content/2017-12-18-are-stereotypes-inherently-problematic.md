tldr; no

Statistical discrimination is often useful. False stereotypes are problematic, but they are problematic because they are false, not because they are stereotypes. True stereotypes are useful.

Below I paste a comment from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_e4LCQ50GI\">a video by </a><a class=\"yt-uix-sessionlink       spf-link \" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIfhPRlif-LJjTp4lZChKEg\" data-sessionlink=\"itct=CDQQ4TkiEwiZ45zzvJLYAhWRz5wKHQGqBS0o-B0\">Epydemic2020</a>. His video criticizes the use of the term 'mansplaining':
<blockquote>\"Stereotypes are inherently problematic\" nah. If the stereotype is true it acts as a heuristic; priming a person to think along lines of truth False stereotypes are bad, true stereotypes are good; mainly they act as a kind of statistical discrimination, which is often useful along lines of productivity-oriented decision making and so on Stereotypes are by no means \"confirmation bias.\"

Confirmation bias occurs ex post an observation, stereotypes \"prime a person to think,\" in your words. That means it would be ex ante an observation. It is what we would call a prior in bayesian logic. A prior is quite other than confirmation bias. All that being said, I do agree with some of your particular criticism of the term 'mansplaining.' It has become a weapon of misandric feminists and others who would like to censor communication on the grounds of a red herring.</blockquote>
