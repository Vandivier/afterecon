	<li>This department proactively seeks to delete law, agencies, policies, and so on from government. It also has the power to lobby for policy and write policy which it can then lobby for in terms of eliminating or expiring laws. It can also advocate for reduced spending, taxation, and debt. Finally, it can recommend cases where the federal government or executive branch is limited and/or the states are not limited.</li>
