John's Notes: This article is my first piece published in a high ranking media outlet. It argues that Republicans should come out in support of the CIA torture report's release and should advocate for CIA reform.

It may be argued that torture or physical force of some kind is inescapable and that may be true or false it's not clear, but what is clear is that the CIA has gone too far.

The problem is that the CIA is a secretive monopoly, so there's no way to prevent it from going to far. It suffers severely from moral hazard, lack of transparency, and lack of competition.

As bad as it suffers from these issues, the American people suffer from them even worse. CIA intelligence, which we have major reason to question, is a major driver of U.S. public policy. Our overbearing security state policy, as well as DOD overconsumption and more may be largely contributed to by CIA problems.
