<p>why was i interested? 1) we recognize general value in diversity but how to we actually optimize or implement it? 2) capital one does a lot really well but good to see what other people and companies are doing 3) general networking 4) specifically, I'm interested in alternative education including self-teaching &amp; this is a diverse field; maybe D&amp;I initiative can boost this</p>

<ol><li>engage and learn - as a white guy I'm not in many of these conversations</li><li>play devil's advocate at times</li><li>ideological diversity low-key means liberal and we don't measure it though</li><li>ethnicity, gender, age all good and capital one is pretty good - but what's the right targets<ol><li>Asians aren't considered diversity candidates at C1</li><li>finding diversity candidates is more expensive than finding non-diversity candidates; is it always marginally worth it? (0 -&gt;10% female is big, but 10 -&gt; 50?)</li><li>also most college grads are female now...</li></ol></li></ol>

<p>interesting that Linkedin doesn't show names; gender and ethnicity bias leverage names. Ironically, this impedes finding a diversity candidate.</p>

<p>diversity in my background - self taught programmer &amp; career switcher (this is a diverse crowd) and I'm from Texas and I went through 1) southern stereotyping and hiding my accent, and, 2) complete ignorance of a bunch of cultures (my high school class largely white and Hispanic, very few Asian, middle eastern, or Latin American)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>one technique to overcome cultural ignorance - if someone assumes you know something you don't (eg a pop culture reference you didn't get) then ask them</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've had a diverse history - capital one hiring manager was lgbt (she was quickly promoted and then my manager became a guy) college board - fem mgr, halfaker - disabled vet female owner (immediate managers were guys tho) - SAIC, female manager</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>personality differences &amp; grit &amp; introversion/extroversion - observable vs non-observable diversity correction (are unobservables important? well ideological if it's masked can be)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I may not be able to ask personality at interview time (or IQ, face, gender, ideology, etc), but prior to the interview I can search for candidates who publish such things. this might amount to direct or indirect employer payment to people to publish such info (invariant to hiring process)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>how do we prove out the value of diversity? intuitively easy but how to measure and calculate the actual return</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>\"covering\": I've covered my southern/conservative background as well as the fact that I'm a self-taught programmer</p>

<p>40% of all managers are female  <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/data-on-display/women-managers.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2017/data-on-display/women-managers.htm</a></p>
