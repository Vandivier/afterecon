<p>learning caveat: no guarantee of success if you try to be a mentee while in school full time; the case of the mentee who is too busy to meet.</p>

<p>In the weinstein vid they talk at one point about leaders vs influencers and in the main the distinction is lost on me. I see influencers as a kind of new leader, where my main concept of leader is Wagner's first-mover-as-leader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can also envision a sort of leader-as-commander where someone is a leader because they can force people to behave a certain way, but Weinstein couldn't have meant this because he is educated in economics, even making scarcity and trade off points in the video. Surely he realizes coercive leadership is net harmful compared to other kinds of leadership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can also imagine a leader-as-charasmatic like a thought leader who gives everyone enthusiasm like the public speakers who sell convention tickets. I don't think this is what Weinstein had in mind but it seems influencers do this too.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally is the concept of the servent-leader. This leader is a first mover in the sense that they are taking action to say \"what can I do for you\" proactively instead of responding to someone else's first action. This highlights that when rich pass on riches to their children, their children aren't first movers and lose a quality of leadership. Same with ruling by heredity compared to the person who obtains the rulership for themselves or leads an army. This jives with our notion that good rulers are also leaders, not merely rulers-by-inheritence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now see that God is the ultimate first mover and, as such, the ultimate leader. He is also the ultimate servant-leader. Finally, the whole notion of divine revelation is another instance of the concept of first movership and leadership. As such, God is the greatest ruler in three distinct ways.</p>
