<p>Much of my work is dedicated toward getting people from a bad financial situation into a good one, but this article describes my advice about what to do once you have arrived.</p>

<p>Much of my work is dedicated to alternative education and programming evangelism, or like actual Christian evangelism. I see lots of people with money problems and this is often caused by having a low income job, or no job at all, or because they have crushing student debt, or they have avoided higher education entirely because the cost looms before them, and so on.</p>

<p>An alternative path to higher education costs less than 10k, is financiable, and results in a high paying job. Now suppose you are in this situation and you don't know what to do with your money. The first thing you can, and should, do is give to charity. However, I'm reluctant to advise that you give all of your money to charity. If you do that, props, but let's say you want to save some money. Should you invest in bonds, stocks, or something else?</p>
