<a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/education/independent-effect-education-christianity/\">I previously argued</a> that the argument \"Education is correlated with secularism\" is fallacious.

Tldr: Scientists and highly educated folks typically decide on their secularism in adolescence, before these individuals choose a career in science. This adds to an explanation from reverse causality and negates the argument that they become secular due to their improved scientific reasoning.

Note, <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/education/independent-effect-education-christianity/\">as mentioned here</a>, that highly educated folks do convert from atheism to religion at disproportionately high rates. So scientific skill seems to lead toward theism.
