I have an account with BOA and they recently spammed me talking about how cool their new budget tool is. I used their old tool and it sucked. This new one doesn't suck.

To get to the tool, don't look in the logical place under the Tools &amp; Investing -&gt; Budget area. Instead, look under Accounts -&gt; View Spending &amp; Budgeting as shown below:

Then you get to see the below view. Images slightly censored bc don't rob me:

Why is it better than the old version? Because the new version:
<ul>
 	<li>Looks sexier</li>
 	<li>Quick View feature shows historical data without changing pages, and in an otherwise convenient way</li>
 	<li>Easy to drill down to specific line items and adjust categories as needed</li>
 	<li>Anecdotally, it seems their categorization engine has gotten smarter. This is based on limited use with my account, not real science from credible sources.
<ul>
 	<li>One of the main problems with the old budget tool is it didn't save time because I had to adjust so many transaction details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Easy to copy and paste categories table data then navigate around months and collect several months of data</li>
</ul>
Room for improvement
<ul>
 	<li>I may be missing it, but I would really like an export feature.</li>
 	<li>The tool calculates simple averages but it has no tools for trend or regression analysis, forecasting, summary statistics, etc.</li>
 	<li>It's hard to tell if the categorization feature is actually learning. It's easier to work with now, but I would still like it to eventually work by itself.
<ul>
 	<li>Eg if I shift Transaction A from category B to C then it should either learn, know, or ask whether all transactions from A belong in category C.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>It would be awesome if we could create custom categories or tags and assign many to a single transaction or vendor, then pull data along different queries.
<ul>
 	<li>Like, I would pay a monthly fee for this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Third party integration with Betterment and other prominent firms to build a better wealth analysis picture.
<ul>
 	<li>Or even a manual entry option to the same effect; although automation ftw.</li>
 	<li>Bank of America notices that I send money to Betterment and correctly categorizes this as a finance category transaction.</li>
 	<li>But Bank of America considers this an expense, not realizing that it is actually a transfer and appreciates according to an interest rate.</li>
 	<li>Same my mortgage, other investments, and payments toward outstanding debts. These are all considered expenses with no notion of equity or return.</li>
 	<li>As a result, Bank of America thinks I am spending more than I earn each month, which is decidedly not so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
