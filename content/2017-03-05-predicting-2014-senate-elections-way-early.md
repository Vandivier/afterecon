This article will cover my initial predictions on the outcome of the 2014 Senate General Elections.

I am piggybacking off of the recent landslide of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/02/us/politics/senate-races-to-watch-in-2014.html?ref=us&amp;_r=0\">New York Times research found here</a>. I'm going to re-slice their own numbers in three ways to come up with a somewhat robust, but very early and rough, prediction.

<strong>1 - Assuming Likely Scenarios With Even Flips</strong>

Let's assume that everyone NYT calls likely or solid D goes D and same for Republicans. There are also 12 races the NYT says could flip. Let's assume that half of the flips go D and half go R. <em>The result would be 51 Democrats and 49 Republicans in the Senate, or a gain of 4 Republican seats.</em>

<strong>2 - Assuming Likely Scenarios With Complex Flips</strong>

Let's assume the supposedly likely scenarios are true. Let's make flips more complicated. Although there are 12 total possible flips, <strong>10 of the flips would go from D to R and only 2 would go from R to D.</strong> Furthermore, if a seat 'could flip' it is better to alot it a 50% chance of flipping than to assume that it will flip. Under these assumptions <em>the result would be 52 Democrats and 48 Republicans in the Senate, or a gain of 3 Republican seats.</em>

<strong>3 - Composing a Realistic Range</strong>

Let's take the complex flips analysis, but instead of assigning a 50% chance to flip, let's come up with a range. We could have a 0% flip to 100% flip range, but realistically SOMETHING is going to flip, and probably not everything. Instead, let's assume at least 1 race will flip and at most 11 races will flip. In fact, I am even going to narrow the range a bit. With a minimum 2 flip and max 10 flip range, rounding to the nearest seat, <em>the result would range from a gain of 2 seats to a gain of 9 seats.</em>

<strong>In Conclusion</strong>

Republicans are definitely going to win this Fall <em>in the sense that they will pick up seats, </em>but it is unlikely that they will win <em>in the sense that they will have a majority in the Senate</em>. At the same time, although unlikely, there is a small possibility that Republicans can come away with a majority in the Senate. Mathematically, the predictions are as follows:
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Overall, I expect Republicans to pick up 3-4 seats.</strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Republicans could have 47 - 54 seats, but I realistically expect 48-49.</b></p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Democrats could have 46 - 53 seats, but I realistically expect 51-52.</strong></p>
