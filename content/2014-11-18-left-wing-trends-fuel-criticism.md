This article continues noting the characteristics of the Democratic Party by taking a look at several recent news stories relevant to the issue:

<a href=\"http://gotnews.com/ebola-nurse-complaining-quarantine-left-wing-democrat-cdc-employee/\">#Ebola Nurse Complaining About Quarantine is Left-Wing Democrat, CDC Employee WITH UPDATE</a>
<ul>
	<li>The nurse complaining about being quarantined because of the risk of spreading Ebola is a left wing Democrat. This is very ironic because it is liberals who are screaming for government to do something about Ebola in the first place. She seems to be acting like an anti-government rebel. The media doesn't want to admit that she's a liberal because, in combination with the Occupy movement, liberal origins of the KKK, and basically most data, it runs counter to their narrative that conservatives are the terrorist rebels.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>This is interesting because it is consistent with the idea that Democrats, liberals, and minorities are generally more racist than non-minorities. It's more powerful because it's being said by a well known and largely respected black man.</li>
</ul>
<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/10/26/man-who-attacked-nypd-cops-with-hatchet-wanted-to-kill-white-people-dad-says/\">Man who attacked NYPD cops with hatchet wanted to kill white people, dad says</a>
<ul>
	<li>Continuing the evidence that Democrats, liberals, and minorities generally engage in higher rates of race-based hate, a man who recently assaulted two police officers with a hatchet before being shot was to death was apparently racially motivated, according to the man's father.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The last point is continued evidence of preferential treatment of liberals and Democrats by the popular media. This is a well known fact and there is much more information around this website on it, but the particular article really does a great job of digging into the details once again.</li>
