Research advice: figure out what sorts of studies require funding and which ones don't. Take on the studies that require little to no funding. Eg, the data is already available. Save the big funded studies for later in your career after you're employed. A small online survey won't hurt, but anything involving physical change is going to be expensive to coordinate.
