<p>From 2012 to 2022 I blogged at least once a month! That streak recently came to an end. Why? Because the ROI of my time spent blogging and maintaining the site has been low. Let's try an experiment by switching to Substack!</p>

<p>I am launching Optimality as a year-long experiment in which I will post a minimum of twenty-four times. If the site is doing relatively well compared to this legacy WordPress blog then I plan to permanently move to Substack.</p>
