This article will address a couple of red-herrings often employed as rhetoric, rather than logic, in argument. So we can get back to logic.

1) \"Something something, flying unicorns.\"
<ul>
	<li>Here is a picture of a one-horned rhino being airlifted as part of a conservancy effort. It has nothing to do with our discussion. May we return to the topic at hand?</li>
</ul>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/GDipjYd.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GDipjYd.jpg\" width=\"525\" height=\"292\" /></a></p>
&nbsp;

2) \"So and so earned a Nobel Prize (or other comparable thing) and therefore knows better than you.\"
<ul>
	<li>Yes, and Obama earned a Nobel Peace Prize. Your argument is invalid. Can we get back to the topic at hand?</li>
</ul>
