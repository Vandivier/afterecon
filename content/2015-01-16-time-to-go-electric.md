I'm talking about cars. We are finally at the point where battery electric vehicles are developing a solid used market, even while manufacturers are dropping the prices and upping the quality of new vehicles. At the same time, we are currently experiencing a drop in gas prices.

We are going to perform this analysis from a primarily financial perspective. We will look at the monthly cost and the total cost. There are 4 groups of interest: New EV, used EV, new ICE, and used ICE. We could double this number to 8 if we want to also consider future developments, but I will just look at the situation today in this article.

There are also a large number of choices within each group. I will take a convenience approach and choose a best-in-breed representative vehicle from each group, based on financial rather than holistic characteristics. The internal combustion engine group will include consideration of hybrids. My choices are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>NEV - 2015 Chevrolet Spark.</li>
	<li>UEV - 2011 Nissan Leaf.</li>
	<li>NICE - 2015 Nissan Versa.</li>
	<li>UICE - 2009 Mazda Mazda6*</li>
</ul>
*I'd be happy to go with a 2008 or maybe even earlier, but this was the earliest model I could find good cost data for.

We will look at 5 and 10 year costs as the minimum and maximum total costs. In other words we are assuming you will own a car for 5 to 10 years. Cost includes purchase price, fuel, maintenance, and repairs. We will also look at a 5 year with resale, where we substitute depreciation for purchase price, considering that the car may be resold. The 10 year simply doubles the 5 year costs except purchase price.

5 Year:
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/spark-ev/2015/costofownership\">Spark</a>: 27000 + 2821 + 3176 + 1340 = <strong>34337</strong></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.cars.com/nissan/leaf/2011/costofownership\">Leaf</a>*: 14000 + 2821 + 3883 + 1494 = <strong>22198</strong></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.cars.com/nissan/versa/2015/costofownership/\">Versa</a>: 14000 + 7596 + 3831 + 1209 = <strong>26636</strong></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/mazda6/2009/tco.html?style=101030030\">Mazda6</a>: 8000 + 10354** + 5332 + 2663 = <strong>26349</strong></li>
</ul>
*Costs other than purchase price for this model year were unavailable. Those prices are unrealistically low for 2011 because we substituted costs for the 2013 leaf, <a href=\"http://www.cars.com/nissan/leaf/2013/costofownership\">which can be found here</a>.

**Mazda6 fuel prices are based on Virginia prices, but VA prices today are about 3 cents per gallon less than the national average, which is negligible.

5 Year with Resale:
<ul>
	<li>Spark: 18759 <strong>+ </strong>2821 + 3176 + 1340 = <strong>26096</strong></li>
	<li>Leaf*: 6550 + 2821 + 3883 + 1494 = <strong>14748</strong></li>
	<li>Versa: 8295 + 7596 + 3831 + 1209 = <strong>20931</strong></li>
	<li>Mazda6: 4000 + 10354 + 5332 + 2663 = <strong>22349</strong></li>
</ul>
*Annual depreciation for 2011 leaf is estimated as equal to the fifth year depreciation rate of the 2013 leaf.

10 Year:
<ul>
	<li>Spark: 27000 + 14674 = <strong>41674</strong></li>
	<li>Leaf: 14000 + 16396 = <strong>30396</strong></li>
	<li>Versa: 14000 + 25272 = <strong>39272</strong></li>
	<li>Mazda6: 8000 + 36698 = <strong>44698</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Years ago a Mazda6 was hailed as the fuel efficient and cost-effective choice for the masses. Today, buying a used Mazda6 is so fuel inefficient that it ends up being more expensive than a brand new pure electric if you look at it over a 10 year horizon.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Purchasing a new hybrid might be a happy medium, in particular if you are only going to keep it for about 5 years, but if you want a car that you are going to keep for a while you really can't beat the brute savings from fuel offered by an electric vehicle.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to <a href=\"http://www.cars.com/\">cars.com</a>, the source of most fuel data, fuel is based on \"current prices,\" which is about $2.15 per gallon right now. Mazda6 fuel cost originated from another source, but is comparable. I don't think the 5-10 year average cost of gas will go below $1.50 but it could go back over $3.5. While the actual costs may vary, I think the pattern shown with the given estimates will hold or become even more pronounced. That is, gas will continue to be a major cost for traditional cars and an advantage for electrics to a degree equal to or greater than what is shown here.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, depreciation is a large concern for new electric vehicles and used electric vehicles may not make it 10 years.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To minimize risk and maximize expected value, I would advise purchasing a new hybrid and selling it 5 years, then purchasing a used electric at that time. Purchasing a used electric may hold the best value, but it is also a risky endeavor and I think the expected value is lower when accounting for the risk of the need for catastrophic repair.</p>
