<a href=\"http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/30/whatever-happened-to-inflation\">Whatever Happened to Inflation? - Reason.com</a>.

John's Note: Great article from Reason featuring Peter Schiff, Bob Murphy, and others. They discuss why CPI has remained relatively low despite crazy actions from the Fed and the government.
