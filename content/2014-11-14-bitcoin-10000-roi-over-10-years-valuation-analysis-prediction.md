Bitcoin will easily double in value by year's end. It's on the blog now its an official prediction. I don't have time to go over the calculations but just look at the damn graph its pretty obvious (<a href=\"https://coinbase.com/charts\">from coinbase.com/charts</a>):<br /><br /><a href=\"http://imgur.com/tyrjh7J\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tyrjh7J.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" /></a><br /><br />I expect BTC to exceed double today's (April 2) price ($132) by the end of the year, Dec. 31.<br /><br />Yes my predictions are conservative. So what. Haven't been wrong yet. Better conservative than wrong.<br /><br />According to Google's Public Data service, World GDP is well over 70 T USD by now, probably just over 75 T USD:<br /><br /><br /><br />Google's data says the world's econ was about 69.9 T USD in 2011, and the rough trend from 2008-2011 was 8 T over 3 years, or roughlier, 3 T per year. I will extend this trend onward in a conservative but also desirable fashion so that I end up with 100 T at some point:<br /><br />70 T + 3T/year = 100T when year = 10<br /><br /><b>According to this rough model the world will have about 100 T economy 10 years from 2011. Let's say bitcoin only gets 1%...It would be a trillion dollar economy.</b><br /><br />Bitcoin can capture even more than that in the long run but we are in unfamiliar territory. Bottom line?<br /><br />\"Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight; you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.\" Ecclesiastes 11:2.<br /><br />Bitcoin should be one of those ventures. We recently passed the 1 B mark. According to that rough but conservative model the bitcoin economy is heading for the 1 T mark. This indicates that bitcoin still has major returns on investment to be had over the next 8 years. Ceteris paribus, if the model is correct we are looking at a price of about $92,000 per coin in 2021. Knock some of that out due to inflation from mining and knock a bit more out for kicks and giggles just to be on the conservative side and let's say it's only $9,200, or 10% of our estimate. (BTC crossed the 1 B mark when 1 coin was worth about $92.)<br /><br /><b>THAT'S STILL 10,000% ROI OVER 10 YEARS. AND THAT'S BEING ON THE SAFE SIDE LIKE I ALWAYS DO.</b><br /><br />Like most growth curves, I expect that the growth will be explosive at first and level off later. It wouldn't surprise me if we hit $2,000 per coin by this (2013) December.<br /><br />For the record that's a bit sensational and not well mathematically backed. In other words I'm not actually making that prediction. I am only showing you a possibility. However I am highly confident of the price doubling by year's end.<br /><br />Now have a video since I always have a video and I haven't posted one yet. Jon Matonis is a genius writer for Forbes magazine and is a bitcoin information authority. This video is just a flat out great update on bitcoin since the events in Cyprus and he also addresses the bitcoin vs gold and bitcoin vs austrian theory questions:<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xKaeS1iLec&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]<br /><a href=\"http://freecorder.com\">Convert this YouTube with Freecorder</a><br />
