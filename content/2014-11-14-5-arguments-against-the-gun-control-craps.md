Gun Control strategies - which I will from now on refer to as Constitutional Right to Arms Prevention Strategies (\"CRAPS\") turn a safe society into a self destructive society. This article will give 5 arguments why the CRAPS are bad.

1) The CRAPS kill people. More Guns, Less Crime.

The main reason given by the pro-CRAPS crowd is that less guns will mean less violence and murder. The opposite is true. When guns are banned gun murders go down but overall murders and violent crime go up. Guns are not the preferred tool of criminals but they are the most effective deterrent. Data proof <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/11/less_guns_more_crime_1.html\">source 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/statistics-prove-more-guns-less-crime/\">source 2</a>.

2) The CRAPS motivate criminals.

Criminals have a deterrent when law abiding citizens are armed. According to <a href=\"http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp#crime\">this article</a> in 2000 U.S. civilians used guns to defend themselves and others from crime at least 989,883 times per year, in 1994 Americans use guns to frighten away intruders who are breaking into their homes about 498,000 times per year, and in 1984 nearly half of prison inmates around the US admitted that they had been prevented from committing a crime because they believed the victim was armed.

3) Gun-Free zones are murder magnets. CRAPS will turn the entire country into a murder-magnet gun-free zone.

Gun-Free zones are the site of the largest amounts of violent and gun related crime including the cities of Chicago, New York and Washington D.C. Isolated incidents such as <a href=\"http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/121712-637367-sandy-hook-tragedy-prevented-at-clackamas.htm?p=full\">the Virginia Tech, Aurora Colorado movie theater, Sandy Hook,</a> Columbine, and other shootings, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/22/Another-Gun-Free-Zone-Another-Shooting-This-Time-In-Texas\">including a recent one in Houston, basically down the road from where I work</a>.

Here is a satirical video by FOX breaking the concept down:

Here is a more serious one:

CRAP laws can make getting guns so difficult that the entire country effectively becomes a gun-free zone, like what has happened in <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/less-guns-more-crime\">Washington D.C.</a>

4) The CRAPS weaken the Rule of Law in America and confuse our American identity.

It is human nature to seek self-preservation. People will defend themselves. If you are about to be murdered there is no legal penalty so great that you will simply decide, \"OK I'd rather be murdered than be taxed X dollars or live in prison X years.\" You will break the law and defend yourself. By making self-defense illegal the US is encouraging people to disobey the law. By encouraging people to disobey the law the US is essentially making itself obsolete and unstable.

Furthermore, our American identity and heritage has been one of Christianity, Capitalism, Democracy, and Freedom. The CRAPS spit in the face of the Bill of Rights and consequently the Constitution. This undermines not only our Rule of Law but also our identity. Without the Constitution and the Bill of Rights America is all but indistinguishable from the rest of the world. As I point out in my old video we must have an identity in order to go through the process of self-improvement. Before we can decide how to change for the better we must first know what or who we are:

A by-product of weakening the Rule of Law is also to strengthen the Black Market. The Black Market will begin to subsume the Market Overt and the US economy will be in even greater peril. Of course this cycle creates a positive feedback loop as when the Market Overt is not offering jobs and the Black Market is people are motivated further to consume and produce on the Black Market.

5) The Government sucks. We need to weaken its power not increase it.

Even if you do truly think that more guns means more crime you should realize that government is the last place you should go to fix the problem. Government can't fix anything. It sucks. You would be better off starting an anti-gun business or creating a product which would out-compete guns. A non-lethal weapons business would actually be a very good idea. Taser and pepper spray have tapped huge markets of demand for such products. I digress. Any form of regulation including CRAP laws will increase the size, scope and power of government. The libertarian and economic arguments against government shouldn't be ignored.
