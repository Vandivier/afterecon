Reading The Score published a new article of mine <a href=\"http://www.readingthescore.com/rick-perry-return-conservatism-political-fair-weather-johnson/\">here</a>. The article is on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Rick Perry\" href=\"http://www.governor.state.tx.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Rick Perry</a>. It seems he is acting like a conservative lately, but why? Is it real conservatism or acting? That is the topic of that article - enjoy!
