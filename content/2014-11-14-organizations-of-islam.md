This article is the fourth in a series of 6 on an interview I conducted with Ted Shoebat on the <a title=\"Taliban\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Taliban</a> peace talks. <a href=\"http://caeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/ted-shoebat-on-taliban-peace-talks-table-of-contents-and-condensed-interview/\">This link will take you to the Table of Contents and Condensed Interview</a>.

Just after the 3:10 mark Ted noted that jihadists, usually meaning militant Muslims, often see Americans as Christian crusaders and therefore enemies of Allah. They see America as a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-19cu3xv2g\">Christian nation</a>. He quotes the Koran, “In chapter 5, for example, it says, ‘Surely these are infidels who say that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.’” According to Ted, while Muslims will kill almost any kind of person to accomplish their goals, Islam only explicitly teaches that two kinds of people are enemies of Allah. Those peoples are Christians and Jews.

The implication is that the Taliban, or any other Muslim country or organization, will never achieve real peace with America as long as it is seen as a Christian nation by them. Two related things Ted and I did not mention are the <a href=\"http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/011-taqiyya.htm\">doctrines of Taqiyya and Kitman</a>. These Muslim doctrines essentially state that a Muslim can lie if it benefits Islam or Allah. In other words a Muslim organization might falsely agree to a peace or treaty which they have no intention of fulfilling. Ted also discussed radicalism and Islam, referring to <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tamerlan-tsarnaev-religious-radical-2012-trip-article-1.1323235\">recent news</a> blaming the older Tsarnaev brother for radicalizing his younger brother. Ted mocks the idea that radical Islam is anything different than actual Islam. He asks, “How about the guy in Syria that pulled a guy’s lung out and ate it…When did that guy get radicalized?” He continues, “The hundreds of thousands of Jihadists in Syria right now, were they all radicalized by some evil older brother?” Then, more seriously, Ted asserted, “It’s all a way to divert us from the fact. The fact is that this was done because of Islam.”

As we approached the current news item that provoked our meeting, the Taliban peace talks, the interview began to shift. We began to more specifically discuss the organizations in the Middle East including the Taliban. Ted stated that the largest and oldest organization is the <a title=\"Muslim Brotherhood\" href=\"http://www.ikhwanonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Muslim Brotherhood</a>. Many groups such as the Taliban, Al Qaeda, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nusra_Front\">Al Nusra Brigade</a> and others split off of this group. They all share many common goals in furthering Islam. Ideologically speaking, the Muslim brotherhood was established by<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb\"> Sayyid Qutb</a>.

Ted continued by describing Qutb’s book “Millstones” as a major influence on the thinking of the Muslim Brotherhood. The idea that the Muslim Brotherhood is a conservative Muslim organization is misleading, Ted said, because Islam parallels leftist thought far more than conservative thought. Ted illustrates this by telling the story of how Sayyid Qutb was influenced by the French eugenicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Carrel\">Alexis Carrel</a>. Alexis Carrel  inspired the development of the gas chambers later implemented by <a title=\"Nazi Germany\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5166666667,13.4&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=52.5166666667,13.4%20(Nazi%20Germany)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">Nazi Germany</a>.

According to Ted, Eugenics is a system of belief which states that government has a right to socially engineer a society. Practically this includes killing or sterilizing any person or persons which do not benefit the society from the view of that governing body including criminals and alcoholics as well as chronologically ill, genetically defective, elderly and other people. It can also imply benefits to genetic engineering of humans. It is one application of Social Darwinism, survival of the fittest, to government policy.

In his writing Carrel claimed that society should be ruled by a philosophical elite. In parallel, Qutb claimed that the world should be ruled by an Islamic philosophical elite in “Millstones.” Qutb took the eugenic ideology of Carrel and gave it a Muslim spin, saying that society should be able to eliminate those who do no submit to Islam as they are just as undesirable if not more so than criminals and others which eugenics desired to be rid of.

Sayyid Qutb is so influential in Muslim Brotherhood thinking that Ted claims, “Every member of the Muslim Brotherhood…has been influenced by Sayyid Qutb.” He gives the example that, “Osama Bin Laden was an avid reader of Sayyid Qutb.” The essential vision of the Muslim Brotherhood, Ted summarizes, is that of an Islamic elite who will rule the world.

It’s not that the Muslim Brotherhood teaches anything contrary to a good interpretation of Islam. Rather, Ted says, \"We love to fragment them, but here’s the thing: The secular media tends to focus on these little groups, these little factions, but they never focus on the biggest Islamic terrorist organization in the world and that is Islam.\"
