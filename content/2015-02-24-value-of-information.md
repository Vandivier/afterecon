dollar value of information - by risk cost foregone, contracting information providers, revealed preference

Suppose some number of potential outcomes with different payoffs and you have no idea the odds, so you assume 50/50.

5 sources of value for my information:
<ol>
	<li>Define potential outcomes.</li>
	<li>Define payoffs of outcomes.</li>
	<li>Define probabilities of each outcome.</li>
	<li>Increase expected utility of good outcome and decrease of bad outcome. 4 ways:
<ol>
	<li>Change risk preference, or change utility function w/out changing real outcomes.</li>
	<li>Change probabilities of events, but not payoffs.</li>
	<li>Change payoffs, but not probabilities.</li>
	<li>Combination</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Combination</li>
</ol>
Profit potential trading up to risk neutrality.

4 Measures of this value:
<ol>
	<li>Risk cost in dollars foregone.</li>
	<li>Revealed preference of information provision consumption - hiring teachers, consultants, researchers, and so on.</li>
	<li>Piece of mind and/or arbitrary gains to subjective utility - When people are risk averse, and most are, there can be a utility gain even without a dollar cost reduction.</li>
</ol>
Rationality of risk neutrality:
<ol>
	<li>Most efficient because risk-averse allows insurance profit, but risk loving allows gambling profit. Risk neutral allows neither form of premium: It internalizes risk cost.</li>
	<li>If risk averse, risk neutral, and risk loving are the only possibilities and we have no idea which is best then risk neutral is risk-minimizing choice, because it is the average.</li>
</ol>
