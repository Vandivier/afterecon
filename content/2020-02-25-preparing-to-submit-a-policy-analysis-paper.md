<p>In this article I track my target journals for a new paper I'm working on. My previous papers have yet to be accepted so I tried a slightly different journal targeting technique this time compared to <a href=\"https://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/preparing-to-submit-a-short-experimental-paper/\">my previous approach</a>.</p>

<p>In a prior approach I would look for a journal and then find a model paper within those journals of choice. In the current approach I looked for a model paper first. My paper analysis H-1B and Section 127 dynamic policy interaction. Looking around the post-2015 literature, \"dynamic effects\" seems to be a common title substring. Testing a causal hypothesis around the idea that certain titles are more likely to draw editorial and peer attention, I found the below model papers.</p>

<p>*This journal was stumbled onto while looking for Labour, and this article was selected from that journal. Its selection doesn't follow the pattern of the others here.</p>

<p>I think 6+ months is unacceptable. The Economics of Education Review seems like my preferred first journal here. Economics Letters looks great too. I'm more concerned about maximizing publication odds over impact factor at the moment.</p>
