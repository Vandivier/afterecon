This article will discuss a plugin for Wordpress which allows crowdfunding inside of a Wordpress website.

I recently <a href=\"http://afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/usa-today-sec-moves-toward-allowing-crowdfunding-stock-offerings/\">published an article</a> from USA Today which discussed the fact that the SEC is considering expedition of legalizing corporate stock sales through crowdfunding as an alternative to the IPO and other purposes. This is a major development, but it is only one facet of the many benefits crowdfunding can offer.

One major drawback with crowdfunding these days is the fact that a crowdfunding project usually has to work through a middleman such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo or some other. This creates some advantages of joining into an established community, but is simultaneously disadvantageous in that a project must abide by the various policies of the middleman.

Enter a remarkable Wordpress plugin, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/appthemer-crowdfunding/\">Crowdfunding by Astoundify</a>. This plugin allows any person with a Wordpress site to crowdfund for any purpose and without a middleman. This plugin has been downloaded more than ten thousand times, is rated a 4.9/5 and the company which has created it has made multiple site themes which are accessible from the linked page which look great and are specifically designed to compliment fundraising.

One potential result of this technology would be a distributed stock exchange! <a href=\"http://coloredcoins.org/\">Colored coins</a> is another technology which may do the same thing.
