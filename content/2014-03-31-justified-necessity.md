This short article describes the concept of justified necessity.

The concept of justified necessity applies to anything which is necessary, but is otherwise unjustified. The simple concept of justified necessity is the assertion that anything which is necessary but is not otherwise justified is in fact justified solely on the basis of its own necessity.

Consider some action. Is the action justified? The action may or may not be justified. If the action is prima facie not justified, but it is found somehow to have occurred necessarily, then it is in fact justified on the basis of its own necessity.
