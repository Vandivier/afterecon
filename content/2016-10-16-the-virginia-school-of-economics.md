<ol>
 	<li>Apply ideas outside of political economy to entrepreneurship, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analysis#Business_analysis_techniques\">business analysis</a>, firm organization, and market and industrial organization in general and in particular. I'm also haven't read much international work from him, but maybe it's out there and I haven't seen it.</li>
 	<li>Synthesize and model Austrian and Knightian <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/rational-estimation-price-uncertainty/\">concepts of uncertainty</a>, if they aren't already synonymous.</li>
 	<li>Account for the Austrian concept of alertness. Perhaps this could be done by constructing search costs as a function of market prices and heterogeneous individual-level search productivity, where the latter is equivalent to alertness.</li>
 	<li>Account for invention, not just entrepeneurship-as-equilibrating.</li>
 	<li>There are some things which might already be included but can be added to the checklist anyway: Heterogenous capital, labor, and everything else, tacit and local knowledge,</li>
 	<li>Perhaps reconcile <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Revealed_preference&amp;oldid=740034437#Criticism\">revealed preference</a> with <a href=\"https://mises.org/library/toward-reconstruction-utility-and-welfare-economics-0\">demonstrated preference</a>, or utilitarian mechanics with Austrian principles of ordinal preference rankings. Bryan Caplan has argued that the Neoclassical approach to utility-oriented calculation is compatible with Austrian requirements on ordinal preferences due to the way utility functions are robust to certain transformations.
<ol>
 	<li>Caplan, like Joe Solerno, seems friendly to the <a href=\"https://mises.org/library/mises-and-hayek-dehomogenized\">dehomogenized view of Mises and Hayek</a>, in <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1531112\">contrast to Boettke</a>.</li>
 	<li>Caplan has indicated Austrian economics a la Hayek <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm\">may be reconciled with Neoclassical economics</a>, stating, \"If Mises and Rothbard are right, then modern neoclassical economics is wrong; but if Hayek is right, then mainstream economics merely needs to adjust its focus.\"</li>
