<p>I <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/politics-and-government/liberalism-homosexuality-and-social-media-intersect-to-show-a-little-truth-in-stereotypes/\">previously discussed</a> the specific case of the opposition of some conservatives to certain gay rights proposals to illustrate a tactic wherein some arguments are straw-manned as stereotypical or phobic when they are in fact statistical generalizations. That article basically defended conservatives as acting properly, and in this article I'd like to show that, at least in some cases, liberals are not acting properly. Collectively, these two articles show a limited case of progressive hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The previous article was argued at the social level, but this article describes a specific instance of an exchange between myself and an acquaintance on Facebook. This case is consistent with a certain stereotype of the left, but I am making only a limited claim that people like this exist on the left. I don't pretend that most people on the left are like this, and I don't even know if being further left consistently produces more intensified action along these lines.</p>
