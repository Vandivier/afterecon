<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide\">Zotero</a> is a reference manager which is a helpful tool during a literature research. This article describes why it's cool.

Reasons it's cool:
<ol>
 	<li>It's a free and highly rated unobtrusive browser add-in that's been around for a while and is bug free.<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6302 alignright\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/zotero-to-clipboard-300x265.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" /><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6301 alignright\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/zotero-bibliography-300x191.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\" /><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6300 alignright\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/reference-manager-download-citation-190x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"190\" height=\"300\" /></li>
 	<li>Some journals won't show you how to cite a paper in various ways (MLA, Chicago, etc), but they allow you to download the citation into a reference manager. As a browser plug-in, Zotero automatically notices when you click these kinds of download links and it can turn these downloaded citations into a plain text citation in the style of your choice with a few clicks.</li>
 	<li>I have to log into my university's library page and access an article from there to see it if it's behind a pay wall. Zotero notices this and automatically routes my requests through the proxy of my choice. So instead of going to the library page for every paper, I log in once and then I can access papers on the target domain continuously.
