This article briefly touches on two unrelated items. I lumped them into one article as they are each small.

First, I give an argument in favor of a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. Second, I give an argument against Islam.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>7 Steps to Strict Interpretation</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Humans cannot conceive of an infinite list of heterogeneous items.</li>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Humans cannot intend anything they cannot conceive of.</li>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">The Constitution may be interpreted as giving only defined powers or giving only defined restrictions.</li>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">If the Constitution gives only defined restrictions then it has an infinite list of heterogeneous powers.</li>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">A contract should be interpreted as meaning that which it was intended to mean, or else it is not valid.</li>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Therefore (1, 2, 3, and 4): The Constitution was intended to mean a list of specified powers.</li>
	<li>Therefore (5 and 6): The Constitution should be interpreted strictly, or else it is not valid. For these purposes, a strict interpretation is one which assumes enumerated powers and an originalist meaning of the Constitution.</li>
</ol>

<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A Simple Argument Against Islam</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Islam condones lying in the forms of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taqiyya&amp;oldid=642284824\">Taqiyya</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kitman&amp;oldid=641569258\">Kitman</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E1%B8%A4iyal&amp;oldid=641707341\">Hiyal</a>.</li>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">If the religion condones lying, then both the creator of the religion and also the followers condone lying.</li>
	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Therefore, the expected truth value of Islam and of anything spoken by a Muslim is less than the average expected truth value of a human statement.</li>
