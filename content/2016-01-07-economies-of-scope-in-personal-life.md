One of the reasons I got interested in economics is because you can apply it in your personal life. Done right, it's very practical.

Here are some ways to leverage <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scope\">gains from scope</a> in your personal life:
<ol>
	<li>Underclothes that work for work or the gym
<ol>
	<li>Black fruit of the loom undershirts</li>
	<li>Thin black dress socks - fold them over at the gym. Or, if your work environment is casual then where gym socks to work.</li>
	<li>If permitted in your workplace, where gym shoes to work.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Sport-Performance-ClimaLite-Trunk/dp/B004RKJQRC/ref=pd_sim_200_10?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=411mlBGCOfL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL200_SR160%2C200_&amp;refRID=06PPVD6W18VSN40XS4YF\">Adidas Climalite Briefs</a> are magic things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_garment\">compression shorts</a> but comfortable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Trucks
<ol>
	<li>If you are actually going to haul stuff these can be great for economies of scope. Otherwise you are wasting gas money.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Certain cooking ingredients
<ol>
	<li>Eggs, potatoes, milk and so on. These ingredients can be used in many different recipes and perhaps consumed on their own.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Github. If you upload code to a Github account you can get all these benefits at once:
<ol>
	<li>A regular work or corporate tool to facilitate day job productivity</li>
	<li>Ongoing skill development for professional coders</li>
	<li>Build a visible online portfolio and reputation as a programmer, even if you are just trying to get your first job.</li>
	<li>Build a visible online portfolio and reputation as an industry specialist. That is, if you are contributing code which is useful to some industry.
<ol>
	<li>Like coding a budget calculator or something could establish you not only as a coder but as a finance dude.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Learning as a student in school.</li>
	<li>Social networking.</li>
	<li>Contribute to worldwide quality of life through open source</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Investing in your own company
<ol>
	<li>Warning! This is risky. There are some gains to scope though.</li>
	<li>Maybe you should try to calculate your ROR? Return on risk? Also is ROR a cool new thing I just made or has it been around? I should lookâ€¦</li>
</ol>
