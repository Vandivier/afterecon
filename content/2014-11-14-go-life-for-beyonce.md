<a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/beyonce-opens-up-about-her-miscarriage-the-saddest-thing-ive-ever-been-through-2013311\">Beyonce says</a> a baby's heart beat was, \"the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life.” The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. Later she had a successful child birth. After the birth of her child Blue Ivy Carter <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/news/article/beyonce-unborn-baby-s-heartbeat-most-beautiful-music-i-ever-heard-my-life\">she recalls</a>, \"I felt like God was giving me a chance to assist in a miracle.\" She also said, \"After losing a child, the pain and trauma from that just makes it mean that much more...A child, you don’t play around with that.\"

What's the point? I've tried just about everything to convince yall and now I'm playing a new card - the Beyonce card. Yall love Beyonce. Admit it. She is talented, pretty, young, female and a minority. She is everything this young generation loves and she just played the half time show in the Super Bowl. So if you won't go Pro-Life for any other reason, as in an actually good reason, then do it just cause Beyonce is doing it.

Beyonce calls her unborn pregnancy a CHILD and a BABY. This means it is a live person in the womb. This makes her Pro-Life. Why? Because if it is a child and a baby, a person in the womb, then anyone who causes it to stop living has committed murder. The only way you can be pro-choice and at the same time acknowledge that a baby lives in the womb is by either making some situation in which murder is ok, which it never is, or by pretending like it's not really a baby until 3 months or 6 months or whenever. Well if you believe Beyonce it is a baby and since we know murder is wrong period then the only position left is to be pro-Life.

Here is the best video explaining the Pro-Life stance I have ever seen:

I'm pro-female rights. I, however, choose not to deprive baby females of the rights I grant to adult females. I'm also not anti-consequence. If you chose sex and got pregnant that does not mean you have a right to avoid the consequence. Pro-choice? Sure. Anti-consequence? No. Finally, while I am very pro-choice I am also pro-life. Sometimes the two rights conflict. Life is a more important right than choice. Why? Because life is necessary for choice while choice is not necessary for life. Therefore choice is dependent on life and dependent rights are lesser rights.
