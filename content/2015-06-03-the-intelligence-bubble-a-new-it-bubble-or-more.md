This article argues that there may be a bubble in intelligence, and it also clarifies why there may not be a bubble in intelligence. We also define what we mean by intelligence.

I am using the general term intelligence to refer to three things:
<ol>
	<li>Business intelligence including big data, analytics, and so on.</li>
	<li>Public intelligence including the CIA, NSA, DIA, and so on.</li>
	<li>The notion of individual intelligence, education, and the education system.</li>
</ol>
<a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/is-there-a-data-science-wage-bubble/\">I previously argued</a> that there is a small bubble in the wages of data scientists which may either be attributed to low supply or high demand and it perhaps reflects a general bubble in business intelligence.

Do I really need to argue that public intelligence is over rated? I will just state it as a fact and leave the debate to others:
<ol>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/nsa-surveillance-doesnt-stop-terrorism-report-claims/\">The NSA doesn't stop terrorism</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair#Discovery_and_scandal\">Bad intel lead to the war in Iraq</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair#Discovery_and_scandal\">The CIA has been corrupt since it began</a>.</li>
	<li>Central government in general provides for the moral hazard of special interests due to concentrated benefits with disbursed or diffused costs. This can be called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice#Special_interests\">the problem of special privilege or political capture</a>.</li>
	<li>Central government in general provides for inefficient (read: not intelligent) selection due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem\">the calculation problem</a>. This problem applies to any society with reduced access to optimal information, not just Communist countries. Any society which has any sort of market distortion will suffer a calculation problem based on price information. In addition, any decision making structure which has fewer minds than a full market will have a reduced number of information processors as well as less access to the optimal amount of most accurate information. This means that even a country as open as the U.S. suffers a 3-fold calculation problem. The only solution is a polycentric and competitive market for government.</li>
</ol>
Next I'll argue that there is also an education bubble and that personal intelligence is a myth:
<ol>
	<li>Traditional education seems to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpk_u_VmPD4\">predominantly be a signaling game according to Bryan Caplan</a>. TIL an old school term for signaling is screening. Check out <a href=\"http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1222150.files/Session%207/PsacharopoulosGlobalUpdate.pdf\">section 5 of this paper from 1994</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/other/3-ways-google-says-education-changing/\">Google and others</a> note that college degrees have no statistical significance as a predictor of performance after 3 years out of college. These companies prefer experience and demonstrated skill as evidenced by something like a portfolio. Are companies increasingly accepting badges and skills-specific credentials? I hope so.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.gradeinflation.com/\">Grades are inflating</a>. They are inflated <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11123-011-0259-6\">even after accounting for learning efficiency gains</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subject/publications/main2012/pdf/2013456.pdf\">Public student achievement</a> has remained essentially unchanged <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2008/09/does-spending-more-on-education-improve-academic-achievement\">even as billions more are spent</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/other/a-short-recommendation-and-defense-of-homeschooling/\">Home schooling has been shown as the most efficient</a> way to boost student achievement, but it continues to be ignored, accumulating massive social opportunity cost.</li>
	<li>As with the public school story, state universities continue to run up costs while grades inflate and achievement runs flat. The price inflation is fed by state subsidy.</li>
	<li>On the bright side, we have seen an increase in low price for-profit education options and alternative credentials like badges or certifications.</li>
</ol>
So public education is definitely a bubble but higher education is mixed and there is some fundamental improvement in some areas. Education per se is not in a bubble, but certain forms are.

Last is the notion of personal intelligence. I do think it exists but I think it's overrated for a number of reasons:
<ol>
	<li>According to <a href=\"https://sites.sas.upenn.edu/duckworth/pages/research-statement\">leading effort psychologist Duckworth</a>, grit and self-control better explain success than measures of talent. <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141015-angela-duckworth-success-grit-psychology-self-control-science-nginnovators/\">Grit is also a better predictor of success than IQ</a>. Check <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit\">this Ted talk as well</a>.</li>
	<li>As mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/apparent-link-atheism-intelligence/\">this section 4.6</a>, IQ scores correlate with academic achievement but it's <a href=\"http://www.education.com/reference/article/iq-school-achievement/\">not clearly causal</a>.</li>
	<li>The hypothesized g factor does seem to exist, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G_factor_%28psychometrics%29&amp;oldid=661009583\">typically explains only about 40-50%</a> of the between-individual variance in IQ test performance. IQ also varies with age.</li>
	<li>I think the g factor is largely explained by Duckworth's grit and self-control. In other words, I think intelligence is in large part a set of trained skills, and a product of grit and self-control. This trained intelligence would be a set of mental skills which are so highly transferable that they seem to be perfectly transferable, or a general intelligence. If true, the hypothesis that most intelligence is a set of trainable skills would unify Gardner's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences\">theory of multiple intelligences</a> with other g factor research.</li>
	<li>While I haven't seen much evidence, on reflection I do think some portion of intelligence may be explained as genetic, in a way akin to physical genetic differences, but the size of that portion seems to be dwarfed by, grit, self-control, and trained skills including trained intelligence, if it is there at all.</li>
</ol>
In conclusion, there might be a general overvaluation of intelligence in our society.
