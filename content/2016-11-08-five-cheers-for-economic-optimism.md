This article presents three reasons the economy is doing better than most people realize, and will continue to do so on average over time.
<ol>
 	<li><a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/index/visualize\">The Economic Freedom Index</a> for the world is at an all-time high.
<ol>
 	<li>And it's higher now than when it began on the world as a whole and in the US and Europe in particular.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>A good historical explanation for the deterioration of laissez faire communities is that they end up getting stomped on by a big army. A few excpetions spawned new countries, such as the USA. Weaponry is getting cheaper.</li>
 	<li><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/10/27/spain-has-no-government-for-10-months-economy-grows-unemployment-falls-to-18-9/#47e937085cb8\">Spain's government is doing nothing and Spain's economy is growing</a>.
<ol>
 	<li>A nice empirical point in favor of laissez faire.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>The economy is better than people think.</li>
