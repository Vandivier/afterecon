Inflation is reported by the government in the US as the inflation derived from CPI, not the GDP Deflator. <a href=\"http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/\">It is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.

Problems:
<ul>
	<li>Heterogeneity error
<ul>
	<li>This effects GDP Deflator as well</li>
	<li>Geography</li>
	<li>Age</li>
	<li>Many other factors</li>
	<li>Your personal inflation depends on the price behaviors of the goods you consume.</li>
	<li>A non-subjective, market-wide estimate depends on non-selective averages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Substitution bias</li>
	<li>Quality changes (up or down)</li>
	<li>Goods no longer bought, new goods on the market</li>
	<li>Selection bias for the basket of goods
<ul>
	<li>Political determination of the basket of goods</li>
	<li>Confirmation bias on the size on inflation</li>
	<li>Calculation problem from a restricted set of minds estimating the market effects</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Representative of the \"average consumer.\"
<ul>
	<li>This consumer doesn't exist.</li>
	<li>This consumer doesn't represent a real measure of economic growth. The full distribution of consumption better predicts market behavior. Market calculations are based on full distribution calculations. This is another form of a calculation problem. The GDP Deflator better accounts for this and many of the other errors.</li>
	<li>The \"average consumer\" is selectively determined and as a result selection bias occurs once again. The \"average consumer\" is constructed by taking various averages of various selected behaviors and consumptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
In conclusion, a more proper estimate of inflation would be based on GDP, as GDP is far less selectively determined and biased than the CPI, although GDP is a simplification as well. The secondary goods market matters for the economy as well, for example.
