<p>I recently discussed <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/preparing-to-submit-my-first-academic-paper/\">preparing to submit my first academic paper</a>. In this article I outline an additional step, which is to select a model paper from each journal. With a model paper in hand, I will write a specific version of the paper to submit to that journal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will write a short version and a long version of my paper. The short version will be crafted as a preliminary results paper. You can read a bit about what that means <a href=\"http://www.accessecon.com/Store/Economics%20Bulletin%20author%20guildlines-2012.pdf\">here</a>. Short paper journals are listed below, ranked in the order that I plan to submit. I include a model paper for the top journal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>Economics Letters<ol><li>Model: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176519303453\">A micro-data analysis of householdsâ€™ expectations of mortgage rates</a></li><li>Why this model? It's a recent, micro-data analysis using survey data.</li></ol></li><li>Economics Bulletin</li><li>Applied Economics Letters</li><li>AER: Insights</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Short papers are short indeed. Economics Letters requires manuscripts not to exceed 2000 words. Economics Bulletin requires manuscripts not to exceed 7 pages.</p>

<p>Below are the long paper journals I am still considering, in order, with a model paper for the top journal:</p>

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>Economic Inquiry<ol><li>Model: <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecin.12818https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/full/10.1111/ecin.12763\">LIFE AFTER DEBT: POSTGRADUATION CONSEQUENCES OF FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS</a></li><li>Why this model?

<p>Tangentially related: <a href=\"https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/how-good-is-economics-bulletin\">This discussion</a> restored my faith in Economics Bulletin, which had been shaken due to the terrible web site format.</p>
