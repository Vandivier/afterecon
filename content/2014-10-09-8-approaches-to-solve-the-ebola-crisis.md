<ol>
	<li>Physical - Quarantine works for Ebola. It dies off after 15 days or so.</li>
	<li>Thermodynamic - Burn infected people. Not preferable, but effective.</li>
	<li>Temperature shock - It may be the case that forcing a person into deep hypothermia then resuscitating them would allow the Ebola to die off due to temperature shock. I'm not confident in this solution, though, because the long survival rate of Ebola outside of the body indicates temperature resiliance.</li>
	<li>Chemical - Ebola virus may be susceptible to an alkaline shock. The procedure is as follows:
<ol>
	<li>4 drip IVs containing a strong alkaline saline solution. Perhaps based in a water and sodium bicarbonate solution. Turn them all on at the same time, causing a massive alkaline shock to the bloodstream for 5 or 10 minutes. Then restore blood acidity by switching the contents of the drips. Hopefully the person survives, but the Ebola is dead.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Biological - Find out which animals resist Ebola and why, or figure out what causes Ebola to thrive. It's known that Ebola thrives in certain bats.</li>
	<li>Nutritional - If we can boost the natural immune system and allow it to fight Ebola, that'd be great.</li>
	<li>Stimulant - If we can boost the natural immune system and allow it to fight Ebola, that'd be great.</li>
	<li>Stem cell therapy - If we can boost the natural immune system and allow it to fight Ebola, that'd be great.</li>
