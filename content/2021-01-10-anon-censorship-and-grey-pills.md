<p>I recently argued that <a href=\"http://afterecon.com/politics-and-government/jack-dorsey-a-plausible-libertarian/\">Jack Dorsey, and IT CEOs more generally</a>, tend libertarian rather than liberal, with an admitted left-libertarian preference. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jla/article/doi/10.1093/jla/laz002/5552028\">Executives of all industries</a> generally lean equally or further right on both fiscal and social policy compared to the tech industry.</p>

<p>and coordinated anti-conservative collusion including Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon which has occurred this month seems to confirm those views strongly. Employees in the tech industry and the Twitter userbase are known to skew left.</p>
