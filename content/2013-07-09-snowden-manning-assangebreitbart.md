Politically far right writer, and I say that in the best possible way, <a href=\"http://victoriajackson.com/9258/govt-killed-reporter\">Victoria Jackson has recently written this article</a> claiming that the US government may have assassinated two other far right media figures, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Andrew Breitbart\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Breitbart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Andrew Breitbart</a> and Michael Hastings.

<a href=\"http://caeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/free-information-necessary-for-free-markets/\">I have written previously</a> that free flow of information is both necessary to the optimal society and a stumbling block for the modern US. In that article I mentioned that Snowden, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Bradley Manning\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Manning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Manning</a> and Assange were all examples of people deemed enemies of the US due to their desire to free information. Another thing they all have in common is that conservatives don't sympathize with them. <a href=\"http://madhatters.me.uk/2010/08/21/julian-assange-accused-of-rape/\">Assange </a>was accused of rape and <a href=\"http://rogerhollander.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/bradley-manning-is-off-limits-at-sf-gay-pride-parade-but-corporate-sleaze-is-embraced/\">Manning </a>is a young \"gender confused\" third wave of feminism type. Snowden may be changing things, but the preconceptions due to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"WikiLeaks\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Wikileaks</a> affiliation are already there. While Assange was cleared of rape including a revocation of his warrant and <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/704616/ex-guantanamo-prosecutor-says-detainee-assessments-manning-leaked-werent-harmful-to-us/\">Manning's leak</a> couldn't possibly have threatened national security the preconceptions are already there, largely guided and reinforced by both the mainstream and the supposedly alternative media.

Victoria Jackson is a member of that supposedly alternative media as she is a prominent <a href=\"http://libertyalliance.com/liberty-alliance-llc-ranks-no-576-on-the-2012-inc-5005000-12-in-the-media-industry/\">member of the Liberty Alliance</a> and she has just hit the nail on the head with the Hastings and Breitbart story. Breitbart and Hastings are politically right movers for free information, Breitbart being very well known and sympathized with.

Add in the fact that <a href=\"http://tarpon.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/ron-paul-edward-snowden-a-hero/\">Ron Paul is a huge Snowden supporter</a> and we have a recipe for all-spectrum ideological support for free information. The only opponent seems to be the federal government in its sloppy attempt to maintain power.
