<p>I have decided to retain my CRO for a bit longer and this article describes the reasons for that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pros:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>I can get 8% interest staking a stablecoin</li><li>I can get 3% cash back with a debit card</li><li>Using multiple crypto platforms is beneficial for reasons of security, access, and more</li><li>The next best alternative imo (Coinbase cashback + staking) is substantially less lucrative<ol><li>1% cash back debit</li><li>Stablecoin staking is under 1% interest</li></ol></li><li>*I can pay my mortgage and potentially get cash back</li></ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cons:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li><a href=\"https://crypto.com/us/cards\">CRO's parent company</a> keeps increasing the requirements for better cards, so I doubt I will be able to get the 5% card or the 8% card</li><li>Many of CRO's ecosystem features are inaccessible in the USA</li><li>The coin value has basically moved sideways over the last 6-12+ months, creating an opportunity cost relative to crypto index and some other investments</li><li>Holding a large amount of cash in one coin is always risky</li><li>*I can't use CRO + <a href=\"https://www.plastiq.com/\">Plastiq</a></li></ol>

<p>*These are the key pros and cons. Further details:</p>

<ol><li>On balance, I previously believed CRO would be a net win if I can get cashback each month paying mortgage and other recurring expenses.</li><li>In the past, I was able to use ACH to pay mortgage, and Plastiq advertises that they support ACH. After using it, I realized the ACH they allow isn't compatible.<ol><li>Specifically, Plastiq expects you to provide an ACH deposit location, but my mortgage company expects you to provide an ACH pull location. Plastiq doesn't provide a virtual account such that I could send my bank the Plastiq routing information for a pull-style transfer.</li></ol></li><li>I now notice that my current mortgage provider, <a href=\"https://www.pennymac.com/\">PennyMac</a>, accepts an ordinary debit card payment. So I can completely ignore using Plastiq and in fact get a higher total cash back because I don't have to pay the Plastiq fee!</li></ol>

<p>So this new strategy seems more limited but also more lucrative. You need to make sure your mortgage provider takes a debit card - but maybe that's a new thing that is catching on?</p>
