<p>I previously wrote about <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/ologit-is-a-thing/\">submitting a working paper to SSRN</a>. I recently uploaded my second major revision and I am now looking around for a journal in which to publish. This article covers my decision process on journal prioritization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Basically, I looked at a combination of four factors, in prioritized order:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>Acceptance rate multiplied by time to review. The goal here is to have a paper accepted within a year.</li><li>Journal quality. Measured by <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/top/\">Repec rank</a>. List <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.journals.all.html\">here</a>.</li><li>Relevance. Measured by including the terms 'education' and 'economics' in the journal title.</li><li>Median citation count.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Repec is public and I obtained acceptance rate, time to review, and median citation count with the wonderful <a href=\"https://www2.cabells.com/\">Cabells Scholarly Analytics</a>, provided through my university (GMU) library.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For relevant specialty journals, I considered journals with a turnaround time of up to 6 months, and I created a queue of up to two years. This is to cast a wide initial net, as I will narrow journals down from there and not actually plan on a two year queue. I then retroactively added The Journal of Economic Education into the queue, because I originally couldn't locate information for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Non-specialty journals are higher ranked and harder to publish in. I created a queue for these as well, with 6 month turnaround time, and I also required double-digit acceptance rates. Then I decided I didn't want to wait 6 months so I kept going through Repec rank 200 to find relevant double-digit acceptance rate journals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/aeri/about-aeri\">AER: Insights</a> is my top-quality pick, because my paper is on the small side, but acceptance rates are currently unknown. If they are similar to AER they are super small.<ol><li>I don't mind small acceptance rates if the turnaround time is quick, but AER had undefined turnaround time. AER: Insights, on the other hand, aims to get responses within 3 months, so I still might go for it though I don't expect to get in.</li></ol></li><li>Specialty Journals.<ol><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/ecoedu.html\">Economics of Education Review</a>, Rank 106, 2-3 months time to review, 20% acceptance rate, 43 median mentions.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/edecon.html\">Education Economics</a>, 269, 3-6 months, 27% acceptance rate, 18.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/tpr/edfpol.html\">Education Finance and Policy</a>, 317, but I consider it irrelevant. </li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jeduce.html\">The Journal of Economic Education</a>, 463, 3-6 months, 20%, 12.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/sae/jedbes.html\">Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics</a>, 795, 2-3 months, 11%, 27.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/injoed.html\">International Journal of Educational Development</a>, 814, 2-3 months, 20%, 42.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/che/ireepp.html\">International Review of Economic Education</a>, 903, other metrics unknown.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/nos/voprob.html\">Educational Studies</a>, 925, 1-2 months, 40%, 20.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/spr/reihed.html\">Research in Higher Education</a>, 1133, 2-3 months, 10%, 39.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/oec/edukaa.html\">Higher Education Management and Policy</a>, 1261, but I consider it irrelevant.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/joaced.html\">Journal of Accounting Education</a>, 1317, but I consider it irrelevant.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/ireced.html\">International Review of Economics Education</a>, 1338, 2-3 months, 30%, 14.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jmkthe.html\">Journal of Marketing for Higher Education</a>, 1398, but I consider it irrelevant.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/accted.html\">Accounting Education</a>, 1402, but I consider it irrelevant.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/ids/ijeded.html\">International Journal of Education Economics and Development</a>, 1435, 2-3 months, 22%, 3.</li></ol></li><li>Non-specialty Journals<ol><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/pubeco.html\">Journal of Public Economics</a>, 19, 2-3 months, 10%, 43.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jnlbes.html\">Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics</a>, 35, 3-6 months, 11-20%, 19.</li><li><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/s/kap/expeco.html\">Experimental Economics</a>, but I consider it irrelevant.

<p>Great news! There are enough journals with high enough acceptance rates that I should be confident I can have a paper accepted within a year or two. 6 papers with an acceptance rate of 20% each means a roughly 75% chance of getting accepted. Allowing up to 3 months for review, 6 papers would go through in 18 months. We can choose to accept that time frame and up the quality, or reduce the time frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's a short list from the above journals with 3 or less months of review time and 20% or higher acceptance, or two or less months of review time and 10% or higher review time:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>Economics Letters*</li><li>Economics Bulletin</li><li>Economic Inquiry</li><li>Economics of Education Review*</li><li>Empirical Economics</li><li>Business Horizons*</li><li>Applied Economics Letters</li><li>International Journal of Educational Development</li><li>Educational Studies*</li><li>International Review of Economics Education</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will be considering all 10, and I will also be considering AER: Insights despite likely rejection, but I will be prioritizing those with an asterisk due to overall fit.</p>

<p>Update, Nov. 3: I'm removing the Journal of Economic Surveys from my list because in this context the term survey indicates a literature review.</p>
