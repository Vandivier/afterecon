Family structure is a foundational institution in any society and the nuclear family is the optimal arrangement of that structure. Societies are also chaotic systems in certain ways which means that if one wrong structure is nudged the wrong way, much like nudging gravity a little bit, it can result in dramatic changes.]</strong>

[Sen.

Leno said in an interview that he expected the law to be used “sparingly.”
