John's Note: This is what the State does. This man arrests another man for daring to provide a service to other people, which he believed to be perfectly legal, when he was desperate for work and unable to obtain a job.

The man doing the arrest was working perfectly in favor of the state, but he was committing a social offense and an economic offense. The law itself, backed by the power of the state, advocated for economic inefficiency and social harm.

Why would this man do such a thing? Why would he engage in a legal Citizen's Arrest of an unlicensed Uber driver? Because he is a licensed taxi car driver. This Citizen's Arrest is a perfect example of an individual using the government in the most crass, physical way to provide themselves an economic advantage.

The solution? Law formed on the competitive market, not from a central government manipulated by private interests.
