This article discusses 5 random facts related to immigration policy.

#1 Economic analysis mainly shows that more immigration is good for everyone.

My analysis even indicates that deporting illegal immigrants is more costly than beneficial.

See this article for more info.

#2 91% of Americans living in Mexico are \"Illegal\"

<a href=\"https://www.latinlife.com/article/4487/heres-a-twist-91-of-americans-living-in-mexico-are-illegal\">LatinLife gives a heavily biased report here</a>, but even so it presents at least this one interesting statistic based on an academic study.

#3 On our other border, Canada is also easier on immigrants

Legal immigration and citizenship in Canada is trivial compared to the US. All in all, <a href=\"https://www.reference.com/government-politics/long-become-canadian-citizen-7de91a944ac636cf\">it takes about 5 years</a>.

Illegal immigration to Canada <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-12/illegal-immigration-and-refugee-claims-canada-are-rising-fast\">is rising quickly</a>, but they treat illegal immigration differently than does the US.

Per the article just linked:
<blockquote>After they’re caught, the [illegal] migrants generally request to be admitted into Canada as refugees...

On average 60 percent of all people who go before the tribunal are granted asylum in Canada</blockquote>
#4 Becoming a legal US citizen usually takes 6+ years

If a foreigner would like to legally become a US citizen they must:
<ol>
 	<li>Get a green card.
<ol>
 	<li>This may take about 9 months.
<ol>
 	<li>1 month for a field office to <a href=\"https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/processTimesDisplay.do\">receive your application and begin processing a new batch</a>.
<ol>
 	<li>Specific field offices begin reviewing applications in batches on specific dates, but at any given day of the year there is some field office starting a batch within a few weeks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>4 months of processing time at the field office.
<ol>
 	<li>Using the same link as above, click \"When to expect your green card\"</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><a href=\"https://www.us-immigration.com/us-immigration-news/us-green-card/steps-to-take-if-green-card-lost/\">Up to 6 months</a> after processing to physically receive your green card.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>If and when a foreigner receives a green card they become a \"permanent resident\"</li>
 	<li>The permanent resident status is confusing because the green card itself expires, but the individual <a href=\"http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/applying-citizenship-expired-green-card.html\">is still legally a permanent resident even with an expired green card</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>After getting a green card, maintain residence for 5 years. Less if you're married.</li>
 	<li>After fulfilling the residency requirement, apply for citizenship. <a href=\"https://www.fileright.com/blog/how-long-does-the-u-s-citizenship-process-take-video/\">This takes another 9 months on average</a>.</li>
</ol>
