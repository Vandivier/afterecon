This article codifies certain thoughts related to my ongoing dissertation work. Section 1 identifies some actionable items. Section 2 notes related articles.

<strong>Section I. Short Term Goals</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Finalize dissertation topic
<ol>
 	<li>I am pursuing a <a href=\"http://ijds.org/Volume12/IJDSv12p123-135Peacock3498.pdf\">PhD by Publication</a> strategy.</li>
 	<li>1+ papers on the economics of alternative credentials. Specifically, I attempt to tie Udacity profile data to employment outcomes.</li>
 	<li>1+ papers on an agent based analysis of education. Specifically, I attempt to identify factors of enrollment, factors of completion, and effective treatments.</li>
 	<li>1+ paper topic TBD. I also need to identify a third committee member.
<ol>
 	<li>One possibly easy study would be to look at attitudes around the subject from employers, employees, prospective college students, and other persons of interest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Discuss alternative credentials and alternative modes of education
<ol>
 	<li>Literature review: Identify key players and papers in the various related fields.Fields include education, economics of education, and psychology.</li>
 	<li>I should identify data sources and attempt to scrape them and conduct some basic analysis.</li>
 	<li>Identify the scope of analysis for the modes of education. Define the set to be analyzed and the study design.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Extend agent based analysis
<ol>
 	<li>Discuss shortcomings of Charm ABM with Robert Axtell.</li>
 	<li>Target Charm ABM for scale or process improvements.</li>
 	<li>Finalize a publishable paper.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Build on Bryan Caplan's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652\"><em>The Case Against Education</em></a>
<ol>
 	<li>Whoever I identify as key in my research should be a superset of the key players in this book, eg Hanushek.</li>
 	<li>He argues that education is privately a good investment for many but socially a bad investment.</li>
 	<li>I want to argue that traditional education is in fact a bad private investment for many, once opportunity costs are included.</li>
 	<li>Many of these opportunities involve alternative credentials and alternative modes of education.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
