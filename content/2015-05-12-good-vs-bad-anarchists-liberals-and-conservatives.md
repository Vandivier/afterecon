opposition to government per se is rebelliousness and it is bad.

We should do good whether by choice or by force. If we oppose government it must be on the grounds that government produces more harm than good, not on the grounds that governance and authority per se are bad. Perfect freedom or perfect free will is not possible for humans, and also arguably not desirable.

Some liberals have bad economics or religion but are good people. Some liberals are immoral people even if they have the economics right and knowledge of true religion (but for some reason they reject it)
