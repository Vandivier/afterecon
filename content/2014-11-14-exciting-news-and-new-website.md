Whether you are a regular on the site or a visitor, thanks for stopping by! This will be the last post on the site for a while - maybe ever.

I'll get to the point. I have a new website at <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/\">afterecon.com</a>!

The reasons are at least threefold:
<ol>
	<li>Wordpress.com sites are great, but functionality is limited. In addition, many people sadly do not see sites like these as professional.</li>
	<li>Caeconomics is not a great term for marketing reasons. It's hard to remember and spell. Christian and anarchist themes also make it less than optimized to enter pop culture. With a new site comes a chance to create a more effective message.</li>
	<li>In order to make money! It is super difficult to monetize this site. I am also planning to write and sell a book! Cool right?</li>
</ol>
The idea behind the new site is to take the DIYL concept I've discussed here to an entirely new level! \"After Economics: Because learning is just the first step.\" Catchy right? Have a great day and stop by when you get the chance!
