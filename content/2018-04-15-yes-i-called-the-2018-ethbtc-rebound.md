I previously predicted what would happen with Ethereum and Bitcoin at a temporal distance (<a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/will-futures-market-affect-btc-price/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/ripe-for-altcoins/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/doubling-down-on-altcoins/\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/odd-bitcoin-crash/\">here</a>, for example). I then called it again live at the turning point:

Here's today:

<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6584\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/actual-eth-2018-1024x404.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"605\" height=\"239\" />

As one friend noted, I was one of astonishingly few who neither called for a sustained bitcoin/eth/crypto crash nor a continued increase. I called for a temporary crash, and not an ambiguously temporary crash. <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/will-futures-market-affect-btc-price/\">I called</a> for \"a large drop that would bottom out in about April 2018.\" Only one other person did that to my knowledge, Crypto Quantic, whom I cited him in the article just linked.

How did I make this call? Refer to the previous links. Nothing too magical. A combination of fundamental and regression analysis.
