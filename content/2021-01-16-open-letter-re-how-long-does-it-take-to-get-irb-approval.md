<p>I am submitting two IRB applications this weekend. I wanted to preview the time to decision rendered, and so I interrogated Google. <a href=\"http://irb.uams.edu/2014/06/11/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-irb-approval-2/\">This article</a> was a top result, but the answer generated an additional question. This article repeats the email that I sent earlier today in order to resolve the newly-generated question.</p>

<p>Hello UAMS IRB,<br><br>I am at GMU, but when I searched for data on IRB approval <a href=\"http://irb.uams.edu/2014/06/11/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-irb-approval-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your article from 2014</a> was a top result.<br><br>Is this data particular to UAMS or does it reflect IRB more broadly?<br><br>At GMU, the IRB team decides whether a review will be full, expedited, or exempt. One concern I have with the claimed approval time is that it assumes this decision has already been made and therefore underreports the time from PI submission to decision rendered. I wonder if you have data on this too?<br><br>Thank you for the helpful insights.<br><br>Regards,<br>John Vandivier</p>
