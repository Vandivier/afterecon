Standard microeconomics includes a discussion on the Hicksian demand curve. This article extends the analysis to the case of a preference change rather than a price change, and finally to the case of simultaneous shift in both price and preference.

The Vansky demand curve shows quantity demanded for various prices of a good under a (compensated?) utility change

1% change in preference for a good looks like a bowing of the utility curve.

We can get preference elasticity of demand and price elasticity of demand, then assign causal shares like we do when assigning burden to consumers or producers using elasticities.

Lastly we can get the curve of +1% price and +1%preference

todo: the unique role of moral structure in the misesian framework (yes moral preference, but in a structural, qualitative way; other fields use quantitative moral preference, that's different.)
