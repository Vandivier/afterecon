In <a href=\"http://thegenerallifeblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/an-update-on-litecoin-explosion.html\">my last article</a> I linked to the <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/List-of-Litecoin-related-services#wiki-Investment\">Litecoin Github's List of Litecoin related services</a> as evidence that you can really spend litecoin on real goods and services. In this article I would like to reference many, many more places I have recently found.<br /><br />First I would point you to the best compilation I have found, <a href=\"http://uselitecoin.com/\">uselitecoin.com</a>, which taken alone already lists 60+ merchants who accept litecoin for goods or services. It has 85+ links to the litecoin community, but not all are merchants.<br /><br />Next I would point you to the single best shop with litecoin called <a href=\"http://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,1370.0.html\">Atlantis</a>. It is Silk Road only better because it supports both bitcoin and litecoin and is a bit faster as I understand it.<br /><br />I would then point out 3 places where you can transact litecoin which were not mentioned at uselitecoin.com:<br /><br />1 <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ltcmarket\">Reddit's Litecoin Market</a><br />2 <a href=\"https://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/board,7.0.html\">The Litecoin Official Forum's Marketplace</a><br />3 Reddit's \"Girls Gone Litecoin\" Which I do not support and will not link, but trust me, it has been a major area of litecoin transaction recently.<br /><br />Keep an eye on <a href=\"http://www.cryptojunky.com\">cryptojunky.com</a> where I will be writing an article soon using these sources as a minimum measurement of the litecoin economy!<br /><br />Finally, as I mentioned in <a href=\"http://thegenerallifeblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/an-update-on-litecoin-explosion.html\">my last post</a>, Litecoin has recently been found to be extremely secure, even more than bitcoin! What I didn't mention in my last post is that Adam Kokesh has taken notice and is now a litecoin fan:<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u3BNiANVA&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]
