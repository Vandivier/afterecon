I've recently been <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/grit-research-is-alive-and-well/\">talking about grit</a>. Industrial psychology has some literature deflating grit which I criticized. That is, I have been defending grit.

One criticism I gave was that I think some of the genetic claims are incorrect. Bryan Caplan discussed genetic studies at a recent lecture unrelated to grit. His lecture was on <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e854/pc6.htm\">Genes and Political Behavior</a>.

Based on his comments, I think my claims about research contra grit deserves further consideration:
<ol>
 	<li>Adoption studies and twin studies are two useful ways to analyze nature vs nurture effects.</li>
 	<li>Adoption studies are able to vary environment, but they can't hold genetics constant.</li>
 	<li>Twin studies can't vary the environment, but they allow genetics to vary in a limited way.
<ol>
 	<li>I asked whether non-variation in the X chromosome could lead to systematic bias and his answer was that, \"the research shows that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)\">dominance</a> sometimes alters key results and sometimes doesn't matter.\"</li>
 	<li>I believe his comment indicates that there there may be systematic error.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>I have previously argued, I also think that unobserved environmental homogeneity in twin studies is often incorrectly identified as genetic similarity.</li>
 	<li>It seems that adoptive twin studies are the unicorns of genetic research. Because they are both theoretically perfect and non-existant. These studies would allow for better separation of environmental effects and analysis of interactions between genetics and the environment.</li>
</ol>
