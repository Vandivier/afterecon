This article points to five useful resources related to the concept of faith in Christianity. These resources defend the notion that faith and empiricism are complimentary rather than antagonistic.

1 - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/8ejprb/how_do_you_respond_to_you_have_faith_that_other/\">This Reddit Atheist</a> Realizes that Atheists Engage in Faith Too
<blockquote>I believe that other humans are conscious but to my knowledge it’s impossible to demonstrate that claim. All I can do is live as if others are conscious, but that still doesn’t justify the belief... So how is that not just a faith claim?</blockquote>

4 - Coming full circle, Turek gives a talk titled I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist. (1.3 hours). He also wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1581345615/\">a book by the same title</a>.

So are faith and science, data, or empiricism necessarily opposed? Of course not, in fact <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/theoretical-development-and-application/caeconomics-and-transphilosophy/\">they need each other</a>. Like two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blind_men_and_an_elephant&amp;oldid=837462714#The_parable\">descriptions of an elephant</a>, the Bible and the <a href=\"https://www.theopedia.com/book-of-nature\">Book of Nature</a> are two books which describe the one truth.
