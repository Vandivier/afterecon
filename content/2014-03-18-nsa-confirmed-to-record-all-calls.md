This article will discuss the fact that it has been confirmed that the NSA records the actual contents of all calls, not just metadata.

See the Mark Dice video below, where he discusses the revelation as covered in the Washington Post and originating from Edward Snowden:

<a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/beat-big-brother-dont-fight/\">Maybe I'm repeating myself</a>, or maybe this is a better way to put one of my key strategic ideas in limiting and/or counteracting a Big Brother State:Â I do not find it realistic or effective for us (the non-State) to think that we will ever be able to prevent government spying. Instead of focusing efforts on hiding our own information we should focus our information on spying on the government. We may never be able to hide well enough, but we can eliminate the advantage of the State and others by precluding others from hiding.
