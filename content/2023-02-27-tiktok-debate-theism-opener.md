<p>There are a bunch of live debates on TikTok and the dynamic is really interesting. These debates are generally unstructured in contrast to anything resembling a formal or academic debate. It's important to appear interesting to the audience over and above actually being correct. Hosts are often unabashedly biased. These debates sometimes resemble a verbal imagining of the gladiator games. Hosts are often well-practiced, having been through similar arguments many times. As a guest, it's important to be prepared, rehearsed, tight, and full of punchlines to survive in a place like this.</p>

<p>I haven't yet gotten the punchlines down, but I have something of an opening move now. When the situation goes poorly it resembles a gladiator match, with one person sometimes combatting a multiple-person team. When things go well it seems in my mind similar to a competitive chess match. So here's my current 6-part opener:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There haven't been that many gods. First, humans have only been around for a finite period. Suppose one novel god was created per year. There would still be a finite number of gods such that any argument for theism will allocate some non-infinitesimal benefit to Christianity over atheism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, the largest number of gods have been proposed by varieties of historic paganism including Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, Roman, Celtic, Norse, and Native American paganism. Hinduism more or less fits the pattern as well. On further examination, only a tiny fraction of the gods of these religions are creator-gods. In fact, there are typically fewer than three per group. Further, none of these religions have the distinct kind of multi-creative god that is the God of the Bible and of the Book of Genesis. A single God that created the universe, the earth, and humans. The creation of humans in particular importantly connects to our teleology and morality. Further, YWHW is unique in his coincidence as multi-creative and a first mover. Finally, these forms of paganism are not taken seriously from a human mindshare perspective, and they haven't stood the test of time, both of which are signs of validity. I think we can deflate the pagan competition to zero, but let's allow it to range in the area of twenty up to this point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now let's consider Hinduism, which has a substantial mindshare and is also a bit different than other forms of paganism. It's been said that there are 330 million Hindu gods, although this is now recognized as a translation error. There are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindu_deities&amp;oldid=1141409571\">33 gods described in the Vedas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/religion/hinduism\">many Hindus only worship a single God</a>. The 33 Vedic gods are not co-equal. There is one creator of the earth, Brahma, but he is not the creator of all things, he was himself created, and he is not the most powerful God. The Puranas mention hundreds of other gods, but \"The content is highly inconsistent across the Puranas...[and] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Puranas&amp;oldid=1135391337\">The Puranas do not enjoy the authority of a scripture</a> in Hinduism.\"</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we consider other religions such as the offshoots of Christianity, it's not clear that we should add any additional further count to our total because in theory, the object of reference between, say, Islam and Christianity is the same God, despite differing conceptions. Mormonism is an interesting case because it represents a case of many gods in theory, but again, only one creator of this world, who is to be our object of worship, and who is considered the be identical to the God of the Bible according to Mormons. In summary, given any argument for a so-called generic theism, insofar as it applies to a single first mover, moral source, creator God, or Genesis-compatible God, I think there are fewer than 50 comparable deities, being generous at that number, which could result in a deflation of the bayesian credit to the God of the Bible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems to me that an approach that's even better than this bayesian credit sharing approach is a two-stage approach where atheism is eliminated in comparison to the class of Genesis-compatible gods in the first stage, and then a single God is picked as the best fit among Genesis-compatible in the second stage. As a spoiler, I think the best fit for which God is described by Genesis is the one the book is about, not some other God that's partially compatible with such a description.</p>
