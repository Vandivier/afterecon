Greg Mankiw has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigou_Club\">the Piguo Club</a>. This is a list of economists who advocate higher Piguovian taxes, consistent with the Piguovian approach to externality theory, which holds that such taxes can correct for negative externalities.

Ronald Coase's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem\">Coase Theorem</a> describes a situation in which Piguovian solutions are unnecissary because the market internally resolves the externality issues, if they exist. As Dick Langlois notes on the economics blog Organizations and Markets, <a href=\"http://organizationsandmarkets.com/2012/08/02/coase-theorem-behavior-actually-does-happen/\">Coase-Theorem Behavior Actually Does Happen</a>. This article begins my collection of economists into a Coase Club.

This club is not merely about economists who like Coase or were influenced by his work, which is nearly all modern economists. Neither is it even the group of economists who agree that Coase's Theorem holds, which again is a usual view. This club is an elite group of strong Coasians who oppose Piguovian taxes, such as gasoline or carbon taxes, on grounds founded on Coasian theory.

Notably, these strong Coasians must support the market even more than Coase did in the Coase theorem. The Coase Theorem is classically understood to allow for market internalization \"<a href=\"http://encyclo.findlaw.com/0730book.pdf\">under the standard assumptions of competitive markets (especially, that the costs of transacting are zero), as long as rights are well-defined...</a>\"

I wrote about this before, <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/vandivier-coase-theorem/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/defending-coase-thereom-attacking-externality-justification-intrusion/\">here</a>, and came up with the Vandivier-Coase Theorem which allows for market internalization with neither well defined property rights nor zero transaction costs. Keep an eye out for my forthcoming article questioning the necessity of many standard assumptions of competitive markets as well.

Strong Coasians need not agree with my ideas by any means, but my ideas serve as one example of how one might justifiably make a case for internalization of markets in an even stronger way than the Coase Theorem does.

Before I get to the list, let me be clear about what I am indicating by declaring anyone a Coase Club Nominee: A Coase Club Nominee is someone who, in my opinion, has expressed opposition to a Piguovian tax. A Coase Club Member is someone who has expressed acceptance of the offered membership which is made by nomination. A Coase Club Decliner is a former nominee who has rejected membership.

For whatever reasons, perhaps even reasons unrelated to Coasian thought, these economists oppose Piguovian taxes:
