It's a common exercise in undergraduate economics to sum individual budget constraints to derive a market demand curve, but this is wrong.
<ol>
 	<li>Budget constraints are immune to changes in individual preference, but demand is not.</li>
 	<li>Budget constraints do not include economic cost, but quantities demanded do include preference and economic cost information (see point 5)</li>
 	<li>Budget constraints respond to change in market price due to market change in demand, but those price changes most be viewed as exogenous when we know they aren't.</li>
 	<li>Quantity demanded occurs at the tangent of an indifference curve and a budget constraint; real demand is a necessarily discontinuous collection of such points
<ol>
 	<li>A demand curve should be thought of as a regression of such points which is necessarily fictitious but still very useful in estimation.</li>
 	<li>Demand curves as regressions should also be \"fat\" with confidence at each estimated point.</li>
 	<li>The idea of the representative consumer is preserved in this statistics-oriented approach.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>In this correct approach we can model good 1 vs good 2 or good 1 vs All Other Goods
<ol>
 	<li>But these goods prices are accounting prices, not economic prices</li>
 	<li>If we use price level for the price of AOG, issue 4.1 stands for AOG analysis</li>
 	<li>The quantity demanded preserves the economic calculation because the utility curve becomes an All Other Information curve.
<ol>
 	<li>In this framework, neoclassical economics models <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/ed-stringham-information-puzzle/\">a change to the individual information state as a change to preference</a>, not price</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Real demand (the discontinuous collection, not the curve) contains preference and economic opportunity cost and calculation</li>
 	<li>The real demand curve (the best statistical estimate of real demand) is our best estimate of preference and opportunity cost and calculation
<ol>
 	<li>But, our best estimate is an aggregated fiction; so tread lightly and more lightly when applying market findings at lower or higher levels of aggregation</li>
