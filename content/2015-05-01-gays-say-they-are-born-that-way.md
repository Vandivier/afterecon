The debate around homosexuality is complex. This article only addresses one small point. It is often argued that homosexuality is not a choice because, well, go ask a gay person and that's what they will tell you.

I personally haven't asked my few gay personal friends because it seems a bit rude.

A little <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/45941-gallup-survey-people-born-gay.html\">less than half of Americans</a> think that gay people <em>can be </em>born gay. While I think probably most gay people would say they are born gay I haven't seen such a poll. Even if it is the usual opinion of homosexuals, there are plenty of homosexuals that recognize homosexuality is a choice.

Here are some news articles in which gays say it is their choice:
<ol>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/im-gay-i-want-my-kid-to-be-gay-too/2015/02/19/eba697c2-b847-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html\">\"I’m gay. And I want my kid to be gay, too\"</a></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2090942/Cynthia-Nixon-Im-gay-choice.html\">\"'I'm gay by CHOICE': Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon faces gay backlash after claiming she chooses to be homosexual\"</a></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/item/20201-cnn-liberal-wants-daughter-to-be-lesbian-and-admits-it-s-a-choice\">\"CNN Liberal Wants Daughter to Be Lesbian — and Admits It’s a Choice\"</a></li>
</ol>
Of course, gays saying it's a choice isn't why I think it's a choice. If I say I am a ham sandwich does it make me right? Can I say just anything and be correct? That would be a fun world indeed.
