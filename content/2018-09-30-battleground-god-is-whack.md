<p><a href=\"http://www.owl232.net/\">Huemer</a> refers to <a href=\"http://www.philosophersmag.com/index.php/games\">Battleground God</a> as a fun philosophy game, but this game is a predictable sheep in wolf's clothing. There is no possible way to get through the game without being chastised for believing in God. I scored in the top 95% with the result shown below, but I was still improperly chastised for 'biting a bullet' by saying God can do whatever he pleases.</p>

<p>In fact no such bullet was bitten because although God is free to violate the laws of logic he created, he voluntarily chooses not to do so. This is the same classic solution to the false dichotomy of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euthyphro_dilemma&amp;oldid=851549186\">Euthyphro dilemma</a>. Battleground God also refers to God as 'She' over and over again, a low key slap in the face to Christians.</p>

<p>Battleground God also places a false dichotomy between faith and rationality in one question and also fails to define terms like 'atheism' so as to create at least one important stumbling block. (Hint: the game's solution makes sense if you approach the question using the weak definition of atheism.)</p>
