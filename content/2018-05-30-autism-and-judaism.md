This article describes a possible link between autism and Judaism and/or the Hebrew language. I make no serious claim about this connection. Rather, I mainly note it as a curious thing and I'm jotting it down for possible future thinking and discussion.

A frequent contrast in ancient thinking is between concrete and abstract language. Greeks are often referenced as the abstract thinkers while Ancient Hebrew is taken as a prototypically concrete language.

Some sources backing the above claim:

Now, hear Jordan Peterson stating, referencing Granden's work, that this is a core element of autism:

I have to say, I'm familiar with both modes of thinking and I think they are both extremely useful in certain contexts.

A stereotyped example might be to say thatÂ business people can't avert their gaze from <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/288370\">the shiny object</a> before them to ponder the general patterns leading to and curing such issues, nor from a tree to see the forest, while academics scornfully dismiss the report of a particular event leading to a clear and present danger as a mere anecdote, even while its their own pants which are ablaze.
