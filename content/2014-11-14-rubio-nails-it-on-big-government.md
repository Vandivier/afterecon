<strong>[From John: I don't really consider myself a fan of Rubio, but man does he nail it here on the problem of Big Government and Obamacare.]</strong>

“Big government sells itself as the defender of the middle class, the helper of the poor. The problem with big government is that if you’re a big corporation or you’re a big labor union or you’re a wealthy billionaire, you can afford to hire the best lawyers in America to navigate all this stuff. If you really want to, you can hire the best lobbyist in Washington to change it for you. What about the guy who’s trying to start a business out of the spare bedroom of his home? What about the single mom trying to raise two kids, barely making it by? They can’t hire a lobbyist or a lawyer to navigate all this. Their voice will never be heard. Big government ignores them. It ends up actually hurting the very people it claims to help. ObamaCare is an example of that, and I think this is an example of what’s wrong with big government in general.”
