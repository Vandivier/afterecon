OBSOLETE NOTICE: This post is obsolete and provided only for historical and archival reasons.

As a developer, working mainly in JS, unwilling to fork out cash, my preferred IDE is <a href=\"http://brackets.io/\">Brackets</a>.

Most people would say <a href=\"https://www.slant.co/versus/48/52/~atom_vs_brackets\">Atom</a> is better. I object for the following reasons:
<ol>
 	<li>Canâ€™t exclude node_modules in many use cases. I shouldn't have to restructure my application to fit my IDE.</li>
 	<li>No right-click association in windows explorer, and vice versa: Open in windows explorer by right clicking a file in the IDE.</li>
 	<li>I prefer the look and feel of Brackets</li>
</ol>
Notepad++ is OK for super noobs, but code completion and the variety of plugins for Brackets and Atom will make you convert soon enough.

If I wasn't cheap I would go for <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/\">JetBrains</a> probably.

For Java I like Eclipse or JetBrains products.

Here are a few cool Brackets extensions:
<ol>
 	<li>In the package manager
<ol>
 	<li>Beautify</li>
 	<li>Todo</li>
 	<li>Emmet</li>
 	<li>Super Right Click</li>
 	<li>Node.js bindings</li>
 	<li>Markdown Toolbar</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Install by URL (it's worth the extra minute)
<ol>
 	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gruehle/exclude-folders\">exclude-folders</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
