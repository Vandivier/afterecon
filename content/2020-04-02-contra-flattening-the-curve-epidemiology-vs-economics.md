<p>This article discusses a major problem with epidemiological models that utilize a fixed value for healthcare system capacity. The problem is that healthcare system capacity isn't fixed. As in all other economic goods and services, supply increases with demand.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regulators, policymakers, and academics are all too often acting under the assumption of fixed healthcare capacity, and this leads directly to poor policy recommendations. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56\">Flattening the curve via the Hammer and the Dance</a> is one example of famous, socially-approved, potentially dangerous advice. Extreme measures which result in downward pressure on demand also prevent supply from scaling appropriately. Historical economic literature indicates such policies are a net loss over time and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52002734\">may result in a higher count of total deaths</a> in the long term, with lower quality of life for survivors.</p>

<p>I <a href=\"https://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/a-quick-note-on-the-covid-death-rate-in-the-us/\">recently wrote about many of these policy flops</a> which have been based on poor models. Another article that rolled out yesterday, <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/03/31/america-could-import-countless-more-face-masks-if-federal-regulators-would-get-out-of-the-way/\">here</a>, describes how the CDC is preventing face mask supply from scaling with overbearing certification requirements that take more than three months, plus fees, to deal with.</p>

<p>The Hammer and the Dance outlines policy and social regulation recommendations for 6-18+ months. A free healthcare system would increase supply along various margins in 1-3 months, and our non-free healthcare system can increase supply along various margins in 1-6 months.</p>
