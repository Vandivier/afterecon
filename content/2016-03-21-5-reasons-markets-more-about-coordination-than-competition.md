This article gives 5 reasons that markets are better described as systems of social coordination instead of systems of competition.
<ol>
	<li>Monopoly markets exist.
<ol>
	<li>If there's a monopoly there isn't any competition.</li>
	<li>Some may argue that monopolistic markets are inefficient but that isn't always true. Granted, it's far easier for these markets to break down but they don't have to.</li>
	<li>Monopoly profits can incentivize innovation and product differentiation.</li>
	<li>Price-discriminating monopolies <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/price-discrimination-is-efficient/\">can maximize to social surplus</a>; don't forget that the individuals working at a monopoly are also people!</li>
	<li>Cournot competition is a somewhat related thing where we have oligopolies behaving</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration#Advantages_of_agglomeration\">Agglomeration effects </a>are generally larger than competitive effects.
<ol>
	<li>Consider that you want a new job in your field of choice.</li>
	<li>The logic of competition says that you should go where you have few competitors.</li>
	<li>In the real world, you should go where many others in your line of work also exist.</li>
	<li>That's because of the gains from agglomeration, or gains from geographic concentration, generally dominate competitive effects.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Often, firms helping other firms in the same industry has a cost which is smaller than it’s benefit.
<ol>
	<li>Like casinos helping other casinos maintain a list of crook gamblers which shouldn’t be let in.That's not competition is it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Firms in an industry can gain from coordinating.
<ol>
	<li>Gains from industrial reputation.</li>
	<li>Gains from scale when firms cooperate.</li>
	<li>Gains from consumer taste when firms coordinate to create industrial standards.</li>
	<li>Gains from information through development of best practices.</li>
	<li>There's also an effect which may be included above or it may be something different, which I can describe by giving a scenario.
<ol>
	<li>Consider are a second-rate firm in a market which can't afford to engage in marketing activities.</li>
	<li>Maybe it's a local pizza joint with one location in a small town.</li>
	<li>Consider the best-in-class firm doesn't have a location in the same small town as the second-rate firm.</li>
	<li>Residents have demand for the best-in-class supplier and they are willing to substitute consumption of the second-rate firm.</li>
	<li>The second-rate firm \"gains by association.\"</li>
	<li>Perhaps because the best-in-class supplier may be marketing in the area even if they don't have a location due to deals with large TV, radio, and online marketing agencies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>In some sense the idea of a competition in a win-win game is incoherent.
<ol>
	<li>Markets can be seen as a win-win game. That is, transactions or other activities inside of some market often constitute moves in a win-win game.</li>
	<li>In the normal sense of competition, agents are trying to win. If both agents win, was there any competition?
<ol>
	<li>Suppose firm A in a market alone makes $5 of profit, but if firm B enters the market then firm B will earn $10 of profit and firm A will earn $9 of profit.There would be no winner, loser, or competition in the traditional sense of the term in the scenario above, but there would be activity which can be described as coordination</li>
	<li>We can still perhaps construct a strange idea of “economic competition” which is robust to these issues, but maybe we should just call a spade a spade: Competition is not necessary in a market.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
The existence of gains from trade which exceed the costs of trade is the only necessary condition for trade to take place, and wherever trade occurs we have defined a market. I would identify that activity at the social level as trade or more broadly as coordination which includes non-trade market activities. Competition is only an occasional subset of that activity.
