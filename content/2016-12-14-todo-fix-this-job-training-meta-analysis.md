This article argues that a good paper would be to augment a particular job training meta-analysis.

Ehrenberg and Smith (2016) is a highly successful (in terms of citation count) and current text on labor economics and public policy.

In a section called \"Is Public Sector Training a Good Social Investment?\" it is effectively demonstrated that the answer is no, but in doing so reference is made to Greenberg (2003).

<span id=\"CitationJournalAuthorValue\">Greenberg</span> (2003) argues that has a few issues:
<ol>
 	<li>No correction for opportunity cost (Ehrenberg and Smith try to resolve that).</li>
 	<li>Misleading results statement where they take the highest-gaining subsample (women) and overstate their gains (\"less than 2000/year\").</li>
 	<li>Does not calculate ROI, correct for inflation, compare to alternatives</li>
 	<li>Does not account for crowding out of private job training</li>
 	<li>Does not compare to private job training outcomes (an alternative policy is to require private job training instead of requiring public job training).</li>
 	<li>Does not correct for <a href=\"http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1445&amp;context=economicsresrpt\">Ashenfelter's dip</a>, or the outcomes of similar individuals who did not engage in training.</li>
 	<li>An augmented paper would further explore the apparently negative coefficient on the program cost variable. If it is significantly negative then demonstrates spending is already beyond the bliss point.</li>
