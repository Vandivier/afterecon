<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently created <a href=\"http://ladderly.io/\">Ladderly</a>, which is a career accelerator and coding bootcamp alternative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individuals looking for their first job in tech, or experienced programmers looking to level up can leverage this site. The site currently has three components, although more may be added later:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>A community or social network, currently implemented as a Discord server.</li><li>A self-paced online course.<ol><li>The course is currently in pre-alpha and free to enroll.</li><li>This course will emphasize React, building on <a href=\"https://www.afterecon.com/programming/an-8-week-coding-curriculum/\">an open curriculum I published last year</a>.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/Vandivier/ladderly-slides\">new curriculum is also open sourced</a> and version controlled as code.</li><li>This course includes a unique focus on soft skills, which <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3829269\">my research shows</a> employers crave.</li><li>When the course leaves pre-alpha I plan to begin charging $5 per month.</li></ol></li><li>Optional private coaching.</li></ol>

<p>In addition to Ladderly, I've also launched <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/johnvandivier\">this Patreon</a> branded around the concept of CoffeeScienceCode. Some highlights:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>You can score exclusive merchandise like a t-shirt and a coffee cup featuring stuff I drew by hand in <a href=\"https://jspaint.app/#local:1e71cbcf03403\">this online MS Paint alternative</a>.</li><li>The Patreon funds go towards my open research activities. These activities are targeted at journal publication, the collection and analysis of useful data, and also teaching research to others without the need for a doctoral program.</li><li>As an example, I recently presented <a href=\"https://github.com/Vandivier/research-dissertation-case-for-alt-ed/tree/master/papers/alt-ed-gender\">this paper</a> on the topic of Coding Bootcamps and Gender Equity at the 2021 Southern Economic Association Conference in Houston.</li><li>If I obtain sufficient support (1k/year+) I will spin up a podcast where I chat with my friends in the academy.</li></ol>
