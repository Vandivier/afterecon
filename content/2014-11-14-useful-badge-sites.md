After looking around the web a bit the following lists the useful badge sites I have encountered. I will continue to update as I find more. The following video specifically talks about Mozilla Open Badges, which are the bleeding-edge badge technology, although not the only badge technology by any means:

See <a href=\"http://thegenerallifeblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/digital-badges-as-new-credentials.html\">this article</a> for more commentary on what a badge is exactly, including a more general idea of a badge, not necessarily an open badge.

Be sure to integrate your badges with <a href=\"http://www.degreed.com\">Degreed</a>!

On to the list of badges! This list also includes some sites using open badge's close cousin, open credit. \"Closed\" in parentheses indicates that the badge is not Mozilla Open Badge nor open credit compliant:
