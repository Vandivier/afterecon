<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Emerald Royce is a new band formed starring Tyler Carter of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_(band)\">Issues</a>. He was kicked out of Issues due to accusations of sexual misconduct.</li><li>While they aren't on this list, Fire Fight is another new band formed by the breakup of an old band which I liked. Mike Luciano is formerly of The Paramedic. So far Fire Fight's best song in my opinion is <em>Move On</em>.</li></ul>
