<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/religion/#bible-is-valid\">Christianity is true</a>.<ol><li>Empirically credible and based on real events.</li><li>Logically and theologically consistent.</li><li>Institutional credibility: It's old and market-tested.</li></ol></li><li>Christianity puts love first.<ol><li>Islam: Submission</li><li>Buddhism: Minimize suffering.</li><li>Christianity: Be Christ-like. This is <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A35-40&amp;version=NIV\">completely expressed as love</a>.</li></ol></li><li>Christianity is your <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/odd-argument-belief-god-vandivierian-wager/\">best return on investment</a>.<ol><li>Salvation by faith alone.</li></ol></li><li>Christianity improves us individually and socially.</li><li>Christianity answers the Big Questions<ol><li>Who am I? Why am I here?</li><li>Some, but not all, other religions do this too. That's why it's lowest on the list.</li><li>Christianity provides origin-based teleology. It's not just an arbitrary moral code. This is intuitive once you unpack it. What makes a chair good or bad? What is a chair? Why do we call it a chair? An intelligent creator can endow creation with both purpose and morality. The chair's creator is the best judge of whether a chair is good, as in whether it does or doesn't fulfill its purpose.</li></ol></li></ol>
