This article lists some notes based on my Spring 2017 class meetings and readings.

I'm taking Public Choice II with Caplan, Theory of the Market Process II with Wagner, and <a href=\"http://www.peterleeson.com/Econ_895.pdf\">Non-Market Decision Making with Leeson</a> as part of the GMU Economics Ph.D.

Caplan notes:
<ol>
 	<li>Publishable paper: Does political knowledge demonstrate lagged political return to learning? Or institutional entrenchment etc. Is political return very long run and cumulative.
<ol>
 	<li>Refer to the class notes on <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e854/pc3.htm\">Information and Bargaining, week 3</a>, and the regression in it, turn into panel data, look at growth rates and see women and blacks have higher growth rate, this means they have a lagged incentive and just haven't caught up over time...will they ever catch up or will it get worse?</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>A job market paper on interstate treaties would be an innocuous way to empirically explore anarcho-capitalism.
<ol>
 	<li>Namely, can and/or in fact do states contract in such a way as to internalize externalities or implement cost savings uniformity in a manner superior to the national or superstructure legislative approach? Cost savings uniformity referring to the economic gains firms face with a single homogeneous legal, regulatory, or tax code in contrast to the costly situation of simultaneously complying with many diverse codes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
Wagner notes:
<ol>
 	<li>Most notes are captured in recent articles. In particular, the discussion on rationality and radical subjectivism.</li>
 	<li>Shackle's work is no good.</li>
 	<li>Morganstern's <em>Thirteen Critical Points in Contemporary Economic Theory </em>was a good read. Not all the points are really great, but some are.</li>
</ol>
Leeson notes:
<ol>
 	<li>Iannaccone, 2006, <em>The Market for Martyrs</em> overlooks the obvious marginal benefit vs marginal cost point. For a Muslim, the marginal benefit of martyrdom appears large, for a Christian it doesn't.</li>
 	<li>Iannaccone, 1989, <em>Sacrifice and Stigma...</em> runs contra empirical data. <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/contra-iannaccones-sacrifice-stigma/\">More here</a>.</li>
 	<li>Leeson, 2014, <em>God Damn...</em> Lol he totally just wanted to publish with that in the title. Does a good job of explaining fairy tale persistence. Malediction not to be confused with real Christianity.
<ol>
 	<li>Leeson's quiz question came from this article. The question was to name one of the three requirements of an effective malediction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Leeson, 2013, <em>Vermin Trials</em>. Wtf. Still hard to believe this happened.</li>
</ol>
