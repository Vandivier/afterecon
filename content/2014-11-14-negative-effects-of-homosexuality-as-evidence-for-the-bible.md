This article posits that empirical data shows that homosexuality has a negative effect both on individuals and on their surrounding society and that such a negative effect is evidence to the validity of the Bible. The Bible has been under fire from various segments of society for a variety of reasons and one such reason has been that the Bible's stance against homosexuality is somehow in error.<br /><br />The bible claims that homosexuality is a sin and the wages of sin is death. At least <a href=\"http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive//ldn/2005/jun/05060606\">two peer reviewed papers</a>, with consistent findings, have shown that homosexuality reduces life expectancy. One study, entitled “Gay obituaries closely track officially reported deaths from AIDS”, has been published in Psychological Reports (2005;96:693-697). The other study was conducted in Vancouver British Columbia and published in 1997 in the International Journal of Epidemiology (Vol. 26, 657-61: <a href=\"http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/657\">http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/657</a>). Both are old and very reputable journals with high standards for the reliability of the data used and the method of interpretation. See the video below where the findings are discussed between Bryan Fischer and Dr Paul Cameron:<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZz4UFH-HYg&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]<br /><br /><br />At 11:20 Bryan points out the fact that gays and lesbians are even aware of the fact that they are at particular risk for certain health issues. The article they reference is <a href=\"http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=947&amp;grandparentID=534&amp;parentID=938&amp;nodeID=1\">here</a>. The end result is that homosexuals die about 20 years younger. \"The wages of sin is death.\"<br /><br />Interestingly the health risks were about much more than just HIV/AIDS. The leading causes of death were heart disease and cancer. The rate of incidence was higher than among the general population.<br /><br />Homosexuals are a high-risk social group for more than just health issues. Psychological disorders including suicide risk, crime, less commitment in relationships, drug addiction, alcoholism and others are all at increased risk as per <a href=\"http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=Is01B1\">this article</a>, which also names some of the specific illnesses they are at risk of as well.<br /><br />Finally, there is a whole other set of problems to deal with regarding children. Not only do children raised in homosexual households gain the risks involved in high-risk social group parenting, they also lose on the benefit of having either a mother or a father, similar to the problems encountered in single-parent households. <a href=\"http://www.fatherhood.org/media/consequences-of-father-absence-statistics\">Problems associated with single mother, fatherless households</a> may also hold for lesbian parenting households. Similarly, nonmaternal care of babies and preschool children has been linked to behavioral problems at older ages. This is observed in single-dad households and also in two-dad households. Mother absence is a big deal and father absence is a big deal. A feminine dude does not fit the bill of mom nor does a manly woman really fit the bill of a dad, according to the later-observed effects.<br /><br />After this short briefing the conservative argument that widespread homosexuality will collapse the culture can be readily understood.
