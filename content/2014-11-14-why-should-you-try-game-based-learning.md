<p><strong>[From John: Check out this reblogged article on game-based learning. Game-based learning, also called '<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Gamification\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">gamification</a>' of education, is closely related to the use of <a href=\"http://caeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/digital-badges-are-the-new-skill-indicators/\">badges</a>. I am a huge fan of badges and I see them displacing degrees and even substituting for certificates in the near future. Also, as a gamer, I realize the potential game-based learning has to make education addictive if we do it right. Finally, the raw quality of the infographic in the article is awesome! Share it! It's a bit too big to display nicely on the page, but just click it for a better view.]</strong></p><p><em><a href=\"http://www.edudemic.com/2013/08/game-based-learning-infographic/\">Source </a>- Edudemic - Katie Lepi - 8/6/13</em></p><p>We’ve talked about gamification before, and we know that a lot of you out there are already incorporating <a href=\"http://www.edudemic.com/2013/05/gamify-your-classroom/\">(or working to incorporate) game-based learning activities into your classrooms</a>.
