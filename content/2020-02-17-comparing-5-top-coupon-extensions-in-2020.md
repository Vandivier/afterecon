<p>I've heard a ton about how Honey can save money during the online checkout process by automatically finding coupons. I also work for Capital One, so I've heard similar stories about Wikibuy. Which is better, and while I'm at it, what about their other top competitors as of 2020?</p>

<p>I did a Google search for Honey competitors, used Product Hunt to find competitors, and also looked in the Chrome extension similar plugins section. I found five competitors:</p>

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>Honey</li><li>Wikibuy</li><li>Shopper.com</li><li>Cently</li><li>Rakuten</li><li><a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/save-money-online-756766/\">The Camelizer</a></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p>Here's the thing - I quickly found out that Coupons at Checkout was renamed to Cently. So I found <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/save-money-online-756766/\">this article</a> which recommended The Camelizer and you see six items in the above list. The Camelizer shows price history and doesn't actually provide coupons, but it's worth mentioning because it may help you find a deal. A competitor in this space is <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepa-amazon-price-tracke/neebplgakaahbhdphmkckjjcegoiijjo?hl=en\">Keepa</a>.</p>

<p>My comparison case is that I need to buy a dual washer-dryer. I have Amazon Prime, and Amazon is my go-to retailer anyway, so that was my first stop. After I found 3 washer-dryers which I would consider, I also checked the manufacturer's website to see if the coupons were better at that location. Below are the results!</p>
