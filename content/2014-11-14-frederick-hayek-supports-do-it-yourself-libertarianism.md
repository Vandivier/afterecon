<a href=\"http://caeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/do-it-yourself-libertarianism/\">Recently I noted</a> that <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Jeffrey Tucker\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Tucker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Jeffrey Tucker</a>'s term \"DIY Libertarianism\" very well sums up my preferred strategy on a variety of fronts including entrepreneurship, political reform and others.

Today I noticed that Frederick Hayek has a great quote which perfectly places him as an advocate of the same idea:
<h2>\"The physicist who is only a physicist can still be a first-class physicist and a most valuable member of society. But nobody can be a great economist who is only an economist - and I am even tempted to add that the economist who is only an economist is likely to become a nuisance if not a positive danger.\"</h2>
