Many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_apologetics#Varieties\">apologetic</a> arguments or empirical findings present evidence for the existence of God. I previously identified Pascal's Wager as an interesting sort of argument that advocates for belief in God without establishing the existence of God. I built on that argument to provide a more robust <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/odd-argument-belief-god-vandivierian-wager/\">Vandivierian Wager</a>. In this article I present a separate argument which follows similar lines: If my argument is true then it follows that an individual should believe in God, although I don't bother to establish that God actually exists in this argument.

As an aside, if you are interested in arguments for the existence of God then refer <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/religion/#bible-is-valid\">to this link</a>.

I call the present argument \"The Argument from Moral Consistency\":
<ol>
 	<li>If God does not exist then objective moral values do not exist</li>
 	<li>From 1, it is internally consistent to claim \"People should believe that God exists.\"</li>
 	<li>From 1, it is internally contradictory to claim \"People should not believe that God exists.\"
<ol>
 	<li>That is, if God does not exist then 3 cannot be considered an objective moral truth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Therefore, belief in God is rationally preferred.</li>
</ol>
This argument is importantly different from The Moral Argument, which identifies the existence of God as evidenced by the existence of objective moral principles.
