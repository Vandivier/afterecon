In my last post I wrote on <a href=\"http://thegenerallifeblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/4-recommended-ways-to-buy-and-sell.html\">4 Recommended Ways to Buy and Sell Bitcoin</a>. That post used a video discussing how to set up a Mt Gox account. However that video was dated. In fact, Youtube doesn't have much current stuff on how to quickly set up and fund a new bitcoin account!<br /><br />So I made the video myself. Here is my new video, \"Buy Bitcoin in 5 Easy Steps\"<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IDCM8Hmkx4&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]<br /><br />The video specifically uses the Bitinstant -&gt; Mt Gox method I discuss in my last post. I may make videos on Bitfloor's service or how to do a bank transfer later on.<br /><br />Anyone notice the song in the background or the logo?<br /><br />Donate:<br />1HT3ykSwHM6oHCjSvQVC9gwdXdHtWnjNkp
