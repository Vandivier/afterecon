<p>I've been particularly interested in Tim Pool's analysis because I think he takes a balanced approach. Much of the evidence comes from key swing states including GA, PA, and MI, however, these are simply states where research dollars have been targeted. I suspect that vote irregularity, clerical and machine counting errors, illegal voting (without malice), and fraud (with malice) are fairly routine across the states.</p>
