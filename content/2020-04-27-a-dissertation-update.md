<p>I have been working on a PhD at George Mason University since Fall 2015. This article summarizes current progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I began working on the dissertation in 2018. GMU has a <a href=\"https://registrar.gmu.edu/students/degree-evaluation/degree-works/\">useful progress tracking tool here</a>. The deadline to advance to candidacy is 6 years, so I'm pushing that. To graduate has a deadline of 9 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My dissertation topic is on alternative education. I've blogged quite a bit about this before. See those related articles at the end of this article in Section 6, \"Related Articles.\" The current approach is a dissertation by publication. I publish three academic articles and this constitutes my dissertation. I've written three articles and submitted two. I plan to write two more simply to boost my odds of rapidly reaching the finish line. I've collected data for the two which I've yet to write, and I will begin writing one of those two today.</p>

<p>In total, here are the 5 articles planned and their current status, with GitHub links to the preprint versions:</p>

No, because:<ol><li>There are important bits I cut out which I can turn into a distinct paper.</li><li>More information has obtained since the preliminary version, so I could form a replication or validation of predictions in the other.</li><li>There are analytical techniques I can use which are cut out of the other paper.

<p><strong>3. On the Preliminary Paper Resubmission</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Editor David Peel provided the request for revision. The journal listed my manuscript in a status of \"Major Revision.\" David stated, among other things, \"I have now received a report on your paper in which the referee makes a number of recommendations for improvement... I note that some of the revisions suggested by the referee are quite substantial...\"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I personally seem to miss the major substance of the revision request, because in my view the change request seems extremely small. Perhaps the email used boilerplate language, or perhaps I really am missing the boat here. To guard against the second possibility I have invited multiple faculty to review the request for revision and discuss my resolution. Because this paper is no longer in preprint, I don't want to share exactly what the anonymous referee said nor exactly how I addressed the concern, but the gist was that I need to prove that survey was taken by only those in my population of interest. I responded, essentially, that I can't prove such a thing but that I know the results hold anyway. There are several reasons for this, but a big one is that regional effects are significant and only regions of the United States were available for selection.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have created a new draft and will resubmit later this week, pending further recommendations from some people I will be talking to for advice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>4. Details on the Section 127 Paper</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EER did a great job of proving prompt and clear feedback. The rejection notes included the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I think that EER readers would be interested to know more about the effects of Section 127 and H1-B policy on enrollment, but would question the identification assumptions necessary to interpret results as causal. Another concern that I expect would come up is the subjective selection and de-selection of explanatory variables based on their importance in a kitchen sink regression, and likewise, the choice of one measure of the dependent variable based on its predictability rather than its economic or policy relevance. Finally, I will say that the writing needs work and revision. This is a distant secondary concern to the research design, but in order to reach its audience and influence future work, the paper needs to have a clearer presentation of the research question, research methodology, results, and implications.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, I think the paper is just fine but the advice is clear, and removing two of those three potential vectors of criticism is straightforward enough if I am rejected again. The clear criticisms in my view are against the argument for causality and against the left-hand variable selection process. The third point which I don't have clarity on how to solve is the comment on overall writing. I followed a Hanushek paper closely for organization and I scored a 99 using Grammarly Pro for clarity while writing in the active voice as recommended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just submitted the paper without edit to The Economic and Labour Relations Review, but I fully expect to be rejected because this is an American policy paper. There are no fees to submit and the response time is rapid, though, so I gave it a shot. If I am rejected I will look to the Journal of Business Research. I will begin working on a short version of this paper for submission to Economics Letters in the meantime.</p>

<p><strong>5. Future Research Vision</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the short term, I have three papers done and waiting on acceptance at some journal. I will continue to push these papers and make changes as requested. Going forward, I will review any new manuscript revisions with Grammarly Pro and ensure a score over 90. I will also complete two additional papers identified as items 5 and 6 from section 1, \"Papers Written and Status Summary.\" Finally, I will work with George Mason's faculty to see if graduation is possible without publication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the longer term, after graduation, I plan to remain in the industry because my experience as a software developer has been great, but to do nothing with the research would be quite a waste wouldn't it? It may serve as a glorified MBA for the purposes of industry. I don't want to stop there. I may teach on the side, but probably not. I will certainly be writing a book leveraging my doctoral credentials. A more direct application compared to those previously mentioned is the application of creating a website that allows people to predict their own future effectiveness with respect to alternative education.</p>
