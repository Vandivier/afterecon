OBSOLETE NOTICE: This post is obsolete and provided only for historical and archival reasons.

This article will cover some of my favorite online education sites. Check back occasionally! It will likely be edited as time goes on.

Sites with an asterisk (*) are sites which can prove credentials, either through certificate issuance, integration with <a href=\"www.degreed.com\">Degreed</a>, or public viewing of profiles which can display course performance. Not having an asterisk doesn't indicate that they cannot prove credentials, it merely indicates that I am not aware of such a feature.

Also, keep an eye on the very much related article previously written called <a href=\"http://caeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/06/19/useful-badge-sites/\">Useful Badge Site</a>.
