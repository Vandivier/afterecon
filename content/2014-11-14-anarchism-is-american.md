<a href=\"http://www.libertyclassroom.com/\">Tom Wood's Liberty Classroom</a> is a great place to learn about the not so politically correct history of America. For example he covers why nullification and secession are perfectly legitimate principles which our founders intended and were unconstitutionally assaulted by President Lincoln. He also intensively covers economics and some other topics as well.

Brion McClanahan does the lesson on Colonial Constitutionalism which is part of the site's US Constitutional History series. In that lesson Brion emphasizes that the Colonial precedent was local government reigns supreme in all areas except interstate trade and military defense. From the charters to the articles of confederation and the declaration itself, Brion demonstrates that local government was a key role.

What is the ultimate form of localized government? Personal government, or anarchism. Perhaps there is a legal and historical precedent after all.
