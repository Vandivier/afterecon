<ol>
 	<li>Degreed has come a long way</li>
 	<li>I looked at them back in the day, noted many ways to improve, and gave up on them as i saw it was progressing slowly</li>
 	<li>Now, they have added some of the things I recommended (assessments, browser button - was that me? what else)
<ol>
 	<li>im not claiming causality by any means; but it makes me happy to see progress and has re-interested me</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Other cool stuff they have done
<ol>
 	<li>More integrations than ever</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>But there is a long way to go</li>
 	<li>Now I am going to play with it some more to update the list of strengths and weaknesses: Improvements listed above may not be accurate as I'm just getting back to it</li>
 	<li>Â Looking toward my dissertation, this may be an interesting direction: Economics &amp; education, esp bc I know some great academics and industry folks with similar interests.</li>
 	<li>Can Degreed account for grit or IQ?</li>
</ol>
