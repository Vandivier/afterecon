A comment I left on a friend's Facebook, commenting on a picture and quote he shared of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Paul Krugman\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Paul Krugman</a>:

[Paul Krugman] is a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Keynesian economics\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Keynesian</a>. The 'bad economic doctrine' he is referring to is <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Free market\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">free market economics</a>, which is good economic doctrine. Furthermore he has no room to ever say 'we' when talking about of the Republican party. I don't care if he votes R or not, his views do not represent the party at all.

Do you think <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Minimum wage\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">minimum wage</a>, higher taxes, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Federal Reserve System\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Fed</a> money control and stimulus spending, which almost always becomes crony spending, is good? If you do not, then you oppose Krugman and support the conservative mindset behind most of the R party. Krugman is for government control of your life, like Clinton and most of the other people on the page linked to the picture. Does the government know how to run your life better than you do?

He talks about Rs making the suffering more miserable when that is what his liberal policies do. The page linked has a default [picture] advocating an $11 minimum wage. If Joe can't get a job for $9 do you really think he can get a job for $11? Lol. This is the silly thinking behind Keynesianism. What will really happen is that there will be less jobs and those few will be even harder to get, meanwhile government dependency and welfare will swell, empowering the entrenched political and banking elites at the expense of the common guy.

We need to reduce minimum wage. If Joe can't get a job for $9, he still has hope for a $6 per hour job. Furthermore, more people would offer more jobs if they didn't have to pay as much. More jobs, easier to get, easier to move up, more stuff being made and sold, therefore stuff is cheaper as more things compete, more employment...Better economy.
