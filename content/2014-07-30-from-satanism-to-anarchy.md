<a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/satanic-temple-exemption-anti-abortion-laws\">An article out recently</a> from Talking Points Memo discussed the fact that Satanists are citing the recent Hobby Lobby case for an exemption from anti-abortion laws. This highlights at least two important points.
<ol>
	<li>Religious freedom is not clearly a good thing.</li>
	<li>Aleister Crowley said the one commandment for Satanism is, \"Do what thou wilt.\" Satanists could leverage religious freedom, if upheld, into nullification of every law. This would create a de facto anarchy.</li>
