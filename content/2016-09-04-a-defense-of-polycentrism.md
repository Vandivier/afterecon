I was pleased to see <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Polycentric_Law/comments/4xrqnv/legal_polycentrism_the_circularity_problem_and/?st=isp601f2&amp;sh=3b8cbab9\">a critique</a> which bothered to address real substance of the idea of polycentric law. This article refutes those 2 critiques.

I am defining polycentric law as:
<ul>
 	<li>The system of law which emerges on a free market. In particular, the concept described by David Friedman in which PDAs create arbitration contracts with each other to reduce costs, effectively creating private law.</li>
</ul>
The two critiques:
<ol>
 	<li>The Circular Problem: A market may generate law, but markets presuppose a legal framework.</li>
 	<li>The Regression Problem: In the same way money is created on the market through the Regression Theorem, so government is also created.</li>
</ol>
Here Bob Murphy lays out the Regression Theorem rather well:

My replies:
<ol>
 	<li>Markets do not presuppose a legal framework.
<ol>
 	<li>Two men may meet on an island and exchange. If there is any legal framework it occurs simultaneously and implicitly, it is not presupposed or formal.</li>
 	<li>As markets scale, at some point more formal law may create gains to efficiency, but this is a product of the market, not a requisite.</li>
 	<li>In any case a polycentric society would not spawn ex nihilo. It would result from a transition from prior society, so there would be a legal framework at the outset.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>The regression occurs, but it is not a problem.
<ol>
 	<li>Most markets have beneficial inequality, and we can expect strong inequality in a private legal system.</li>
 	<li>It may be the case that the most efficient PDA becomes so dominant that it is colloquially considered a government.</li>
 	<li>However, this government is importantly different from the traditional state where a state is a geographic monopoly on the use of force.</li>
 	<li>A dominant PDA is not expected to be a monopoly on the use of force and neither is it expected to be geographically oriented.</li>
 	<li>PDA dominance is also expected to see high turnover. That is, the market-leading PDA one year is unlikely to sustain the position in the long run.</li>
 	<li>Competition and individual sovereignty are importantly in effect. If a dominant PDA attempts abuse, it is expected to quickly be replaced.</li>
 	<li>So inefficiency, abuse, corruption, and all the other undesirable qualities of the state are still minimized as expected on the market, even if the market has some leading firm at some point in time.</li>
</ol>

Side note: I have been a long time resident of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism\">/r/anarcho_capitalism</a>, despite the fact that I got <a href=\"http://nullprogram.com/am-i-shadowbanned/\">shadowbanned</a> and I'm better described as a polycentrist anyway. I was pleased to see that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Polycentric_Law\">/r/Polycentric_Law</a> has been growing, but after being shadowbanned I cannot contribute much anymore. Now I have taken up <a href=\"https://voat.co/\">Voat</a> and <a href=\"https://steemit.com/\">Steemit</a> as substitutes, and I encourage the reader to check those sites out.
