<p>This article defines a real estate portfolio, notes some portfolio lending resources, and discusses when using such resources might be a good or bad idea.</p>

<p>This month I closed on my first investment property. I will actually be receiving a check, rather than paying closing costs, at closing. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9KqIqZIZGk\">more here</a>.</p>

<p>I will now be the owner of two properties, so obtaining a portfolio loan is a serious consideration. A real estate portfolio is a collection of one or more real estate properties, so a portfolio loan can technically be issues even on a single property. While technically one or more properties constitutes a portfolio, lenders vary widely in the specific portfolio lending options they offer. It's common to see a minimum property number of 3 or 5, or a minimum property value of $500,000 (2018).</p>

<p>Standard LTV on a portfolio loan is 75%, but some specialty lenders can go for 80%+. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bztNHVei0WI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=64\">Just ask</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some specific portfolio loan options:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>So while one or two lenders may exist for almost any portfolio composition, many portfolio lenders begin to overlap with 5 or more properties and more than $1M in portfolio value. Obviously, competition drives marginally better terms for the consumer.</p>

<p>Portfolio loans come in <a href=\"https://fitsmallbusiness.com/portfolio-loan-mortgages/\">different flavors</a>. Here are some different loan types and situations in which you might want to use each type:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>Portfolio purchase<ol><li>Use when buying a portfolio</li><li>Use when you want to leverage equity in a portfolio toward the purchase of an additional property</li></ol></li><li>Cash out refinance<ol><li>Use when you want to extract equity from a portfolio for any purpose</li></ol></li><li>Ordinary refinance<ol><li>Use when you want to consolidate multiple property payments into a single payment, reduce monthly payment, or reduce the rate on a loan</li></ol></li><li>Interest only<br/><ol><li>Use when you want to minimize monthly payments</li></ol></li></ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When does a portfolio loan not makes sense? Here are some cases:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>One or more properties are cash-flow negative or you would be better off just selling</li><li>The portfolio loan would result in a higher average interest rate across properties or would increase monthly payments</li><li>Portfolio default can result in all properties being foreclosed</li><li>Individual properties within a portfolio may be harder to sell, finance, insure, or contract in a special way</li></ol>
