<p>Political leaders have already jumped to leverage this crisis into pork for their interest, passing a $2 T package which is 50-80% nonsense. I'll list some of the problematic line-items later in this post. My key point in this post is to highlight the fact that the US had the world's best healthcare response before this bill was passed.</p>

<p>I'm sure political leaders will try to pin our resilience to the CARES Act and therefore justify its insane content, but the truth is before the bill was passed we already had the world's lowest death rate, even despite having the world's largest number of confirmed cases, per Johns Hopkins via <a href=\"https://en.as.com/en/2020/03/28/other_sports/1585381953_902931.html\">this article</a>:</p>

<p>The trustworthiness of the data above varies by country, but taking it at face value the US death rate is ~1.5% while the global death rate is ~5%. This top-level comparison is certainly omitting many important variables such as pandemic start time within country, demographic factors, economic factors, and policy factors. Without further data, the US preferred effect causal explanation should be shared equally across those speculated factors.</p>

<p>The death rate, or life-year cost, of negative economic implications of recent policy actions is much harder to calculate, but I suspect even more grave in the long run. Kudos to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Massie&amp;oldid=947778720\">Rep. Thomas Massie</a> (KY) for attempting the voice vote.</p>

<p>The number of poor policy responses during this pandemic are too numerous to count:</p>

<p>Our healthcare policy response has also been tragic. Below is a list of problematic health initiatives. A couple articles are from today and yesterday, but several others are much older and I simply forgot to include them in the initial post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep in mind that even prior to these policy response failures, the US healthcare system cannot be described as free market due to long-standing regulation and licensing, plus additional heavy-handed regulation and cost controls introduced more recently <a href=\"https://fee.org/articles/obamacare-is-literally-killing-us/\">as part of Obamacare / ACA</a>.</p>

<p>Note that harming the economy is also a health issue. Contrast Sweden's approach with the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-stimulus-package-to-exceed-6t-larry-kudlow-says/\">$6T US Stimulus</a>.</p>
