<p>Getting a large amount of quality data on evil people is hard to do. Case studies about people regarded as evil may be insightful, but the sample size is low and one wonders about other data reliability problems such as the authorship of history by the victor and the problems of popular science. Survey methods generally fail because one can't simply ask, \"So hey, are you evil?\"</p>

<p>I recently ran into a paper discussing the so-called Dark Triad of psychological traits. This turns out to be a whole literature rather than a lone paper. I'm just starting to investigate this literature, but it seems to be the case that psychologists have a fairly credibly profile of an evil personality. That is, persons with a personality who are predisposed to doing things like lying, cheating and stealing. To be clear, I'm not suggesting someone is evil simply for having such a personality, but it precurses, predicts, and causally correlates when sampled at scale.</p>
