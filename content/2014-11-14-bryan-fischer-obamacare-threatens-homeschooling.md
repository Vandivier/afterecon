<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Homeschooling\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Homeschooling</a> takes power from the central government and gives it to the family in a very powerful way, through education. It is freedom at its finest.

Homeschooling not only produces consistently better results, it does so cheaper, in a way that minimizes government, in a way that maximizes personal responsibility, in a way that strengthens familial bonds, and in a morally superior way. See <a href=\"http://caeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/a-short-recommendation-and-defense-of-homeschooling/\">this article</a> in which I go into further detail on homeschooling's positive characteristics.

<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">ObamaCare</a> has been criticized by opponents and also called a \"train wreck\" by its own supportersÂ <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/aug/06/context-obamacare-train-wreck/\">Harry Reid and Max Baucus</a>, among very many others. It has also variously been called the ACA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or even ChernobylCare as a reference to its immensely destructive and failed nature. Now there is a new complaint to level against the thing. <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Bryan Fischer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fischer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Bryan Fischer</a> of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"American Family Radio\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Radio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">American Family Radio</a> hosts the radio show, \"Focal Point with Bryan Fischer.\" He recently reported that ObamaCare represents a threat to homeschooling. Skip to the 5:20 mark and watch this clip from his show:
