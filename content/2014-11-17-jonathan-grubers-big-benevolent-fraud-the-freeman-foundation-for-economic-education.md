<a href=\"http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/jonathan-grubers-big-benevolent-fraud\">Jonathan Gruber's Big, Benevolent Fraud : The Freeman : Foundation for Economic Education</a>.

John's note: A central tenet of economics is that free information produces efficient results. Secrecy and misinformation is never preferable to free information for efficiency from an honest economic standpoint.

Gruber, like Krugman, is a joke of an economist. He's a partisan hack.
