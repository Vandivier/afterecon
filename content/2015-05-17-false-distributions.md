This article will specifically prove that survey question wording can result in a misleading response distribution in service of a general theory that different technique in the gathering or aggregating of data can result in a different response distribution.

This is important because differing response distributions can lead to different conclusions including policy recommendations and an inferior choice may be made as a result. It is also important as a demonstration that scholarly technique at the individual level is inherently central, systematic, and non-robust.
