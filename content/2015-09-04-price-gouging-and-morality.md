My position:
<ol>
	<li>Price gouging is sometimes less than optimally moral and efficient.</li>
	<li>The status as immoral or inefficient depends in part on the degree of gouging.</li>
	<li>It should be legal anyway.</li>
</ol>
Common sense pro my position:
<ul>
	<li>Price gouging is probably not bad if the recipient is happy after all</li>
	<li>If they aren't happy you may be a dick, and dick moves are generally not morally optimal</li>
	<li>All things in moderation, goldilocks usually in middle: optimal is prob between perf gouging and charity</li>
</ul>
More rigorous:
<ul>
	<li>Argument from coercion
<ul>
	<li>If alternative is buy or die, coercion is being conducted.</li>
	<li>Smaller degrees of harm also count as coercion.</li>
	<li>Some people think coercion is morally suboptimal and/or inefficient
<ul>
	<li>Although personally I don't necessarily think that's the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Argument from charitable utility
<ul>
	<li>My personal favorite argument against price gouging.</li>
	<li>It could be that (omg no way) giving a starving guy food for free is morally optimal and/or efficient.</li>
	<li>Some non-heartless people actually get utility from such things as helping others</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Argument from religion
<ul>
	<li>What is the best thing to do in a price gouging situation? First, realize that \"best\" is a moral or normative term and requires a justified moral framework to answer in a rigorous way.</li>
	<li>Divine command theory (or divine will theory) is perhaps the best moral framework.</li>
	<li>If certain religions are your moral standard then gouging is immoral.</li>
	<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#Christianity\">Usury is considered immoral in Christianity</a>, and while usury is technically a lending consideration, there is a general moral principle along the same lines which is don't take advantage of the weak or needy.</li>
	<li>However, foregoing earnings or being irresponsible with wealth is also condemned in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_talents_or_minas\">Parable of Talents</a> in the New Testament. So it's not clear that perfect charity is ideal either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Argument from empathetic guilt and/or subjective value
<ul>
	<li>Personally I would feel guilty charging $10k for a gallon of water to a guy dying of thirst.</li>
	<li>If my conscience is a guide to the morally optimal choice then charging as much as possible is not the \"best\" thing to do.</li>
	<li>If value is truly subjective, then that is not the efficient thing to do either.</li>
	<li>Also, guilt itself is a reduction in utility, so charging less would be better inclusive of charitable utility. Morally and in terms of utilitarian and economic efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Rebuttle of pro opposition arguments:
<ul>
	<li>Incentives argument is true, but perfect gouging not needed for these incentives; only partial gouging</li>
	<li>Going to hell is a solid incentive as well</li>
	<li>Efficiency is not a clear moral standard. Divine command or will theories are better.
<ul>
	<li>Not that clearly efficiency is clearly immoral either. It seems morally neutral. That is not a way to determine which choice is best.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Efficiency depends on perceived or anticipated costs and benefits, not accidental ones.
<ul>
	<li>Accidental earnings are shocks which cause calculation issues and actually inhibit efficiency.</li>
	<li>If you intentionally aid a disaster area though, that is different.</li>
	<li>So gouging in a shock scenario is opportunistic and unnecessary, not efficient, but planned \"gouging\" is the natural working of the market when demand rises.</li>
	<li>However, planned gouging presupposes available information which will likely lead to competition among suppliers, dampening the severity of any price increase.</li>
	<li>Shock scenarios of spiked demand with limited supply prevents proper competition from dampening the severity of price increases. In effect, an opportunistic gouger can act as a monopolist, which is neither efficient nor morally optimal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Why should it be legal anyway?
<ol>
	<li>Efficiency: Calculation problem. What degree is optimal? Government is a bad calculator.</li>
	<li>Moral: Laws should be based on a moral truth. The moral status here is variable, not certain.</li>
	<li>Pragmatic: Laws in general should be minimized. If we aren't sure of a law, don't have it.</li>
	<li>Slippery slope: give government an inch and they will take a mile. don't empower them.</li>
</ol>
