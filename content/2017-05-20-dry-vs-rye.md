<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108538\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a> is a good first-pass rule of thumb, but RYE is optimal. “Repeat yourself efficiently”</p>
<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108543\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoNormal\">Examples:</p>

<ol id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108546\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">
 	<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108545\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoListParagraph\">Add a data-attr to an HTML element so that some data can be read from it using $elem.data() rather than a longer jQuery selector chain $elem.closest(‘.thing’).find(‘otherthing’).val()
<ol id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108548\" start=\"1\" type=\"a\">
 	<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108547\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoListParagraph\">Benefits of concision, readability, and performance</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108549\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoListParagraph\">Database normalization
<ol id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108551\" start=\"1\" type=\"a\">
 	<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108550\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoListParagraph\">Foreign key relationships are duplicate but useful to improve database query speed when only a subset of information is needed</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108552\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoListParagraph\">Complexity management
<ol id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108554\" start=\"1\" type=\"a\">
 	<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108553\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoListParagraph\">When a URL or string is repeated many times, put it in a constants service for scale and maintenance</li>
 	<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108564\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoListParagraph\">But, when a constant is only repeated once, twice, or even a few times this doesn’t make sense. You are adding a service to develop and integrate with very little benefit. In particular, consider strings that are unlikely to ever need an update, such as $el.css(‘color’, color); that color string will prob never change. Also consider numbers – why have CONSTANTS.FIVE_HUNDRED instead of 500? Even if 500 is used 500 times, it wouldn’t make sense to make this a constant. Constants are useful in part so you have a central location to update; when will you ever need to update the constant value FIVE_HUNDRED to anything other than 500? You won’t. That’s overengineering.</li>

<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1495153504695_108565\" class=\"yiv8046435758MsoNormal\"> I would say, though, “When in doubt, DRY it out”</p>
