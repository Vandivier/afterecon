Sources show that over 99% of abortions are not from rape victims (<a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_abortions_have_something_to_do_with_rape\">1</a>,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/13/us/rape-and-incest-just-1-of-all-abortions.html\">2</a> and <a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061114200923AAy5zMs\">3</a>). See the screenshot of a modest Google search for top results:

Rape also rarely, <a href=\"http://health.act.gov.au/health-services/canberra-hospital/our-services/medical-services/sexual-health/sexual-assault-care/rape-related-pregnancy\">about 5% of the time</a> to be precise, results in pregnancy due to rape's wide definition encompassing attempted rape and also all kinds of sexual acts which cannot result in pregnancy. I won't be detailed but you can imagine. Even women who were raped and had a pregnancy result still choose not to have an abortion <a href=\"http://afterabortion.org/2004/rape-incest-and-abortion-searching-beyond-the-myths-3/\">75-85% of the time</a>. Perhaps this is because they understand that although they have been through hell and back, their pregnancy is nonetheless still a live human being. Committing murder of an innocent does nothing to hold the rapist accountable, as <a href=\"http://www.priestsforlife.org/articles/rapeandabortion.html\">this article</a> points out.

Of those who don't die and are able to respond to surveys, <a href=\"http://afterabortion.org/1999/a-detailed-survey-of-post-abortion-psychological-reactions/\">about 94%*</a> regret their abortion for various reasons. Sad as it may be for those 6% of 1%, it would benefit the millions of unborn babies as well as the hundreds of thousands of traumatized regretful post-abortive women if abortion was simply absolutely outlawed. It is legally irresponsible to allow abortion, even for rape.

*UPDATE: Looks like that 94% is derived with selection bias. <a href=\"http://time.com/3956781/women-abortion-regret-reproductive-health/\">Time sites a recent study</a> claiming 95% of women <em>don't</em> regret abortion. Hm. Is that better or worse?

The following Facebook conversation, modestly edited for privacy, raises some other points:

<a href=\"http://imgur.com/mjJT5Xn\"><img title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mjJT5Xn.png\" /></a>

One strong point raised is that the term \"Pro-Choice\" is a misnomer from the get-go. Another point is that to refute the Pro-Life argument you must not see an unborn baby as a human which takes some kind of foreign and morally bankrupt thought process. Perhaps this explains the tiny fraction of women who don't regret abortion. They don't have a morally coherent thought process. In the conversation you can also see the leftist ideology clearly emerging as the Pro-Choice arguer brings up the similarly leftist and morally bankrupt idea of homosexuals being able to marry.

Don't even get me started on the international trends such as <a href=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/faith-and-morals/item/15110-130000-forced-abortions-in-china-chen-guangcheng-tells-congress\">China's forced abortion</a> or <a href=\"http://cgi.unc.edu/uploads/media_items/the-practice-of-sex-selective-abortion-in-india-may-you-be-the-mother-of-a-hundred-sons.original.pdf\">India's extreme sex-selective abortion</a>.

In conclusion, I hope this article has convinced you that abortion is wrong and should be outlawed. If my points didn't convince you <a href=\"http://thegenerallifeblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/go-life-for-beyonce.html\">perhaps Beyonce will</a>. If she doesn't then perhaps you may need some of the grim details of what exactly an abortion entails, according to <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/16/17761549-gosnell-murder-trial-grisly-testimony-of-abortions-gone-wrong?lite\">testimony heard in the recent Gosnell trial</a> for example (Tldr: \"It was literally a beheading\"). Note that <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-abortion-doctor-verdict-20130513,0,6359413.story\">Gosnell was later found guilty</a> of several counts of first degree murder of babies. Lastly, if that doesn't convince you, perhaps these women will:
