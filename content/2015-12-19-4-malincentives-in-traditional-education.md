This article covers four malincentives which exist in traditional education. I also suggest some alternative modes of learning which reduce these problems.

For the sake of this article, the working definition of traditional education is the classroom-teacher model, or <a href=\"http://education.seattlepi.com/advantages-traditional-schools-2140.html\">teacher-centered delivery</a>. Various malincentives exist with this model:
<ol>
	<li>Centralized decision making is prone to cognitive bias on the part of the teacher.</li>
	<li>Centralized decision making is subject to a variant of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem\">the Calculation Problem</a>.</li>
	<li>Traditional education minimizes the teacher stake in student learning and creates a situation of diminishing returns to expected grade from student effort.
<ol>
	<li>If the student is too inquisitive he may wear out, annoy, or threaten a teacher.</li>
	<li>The teacher generally doesn't gain additional revenue from tolerating such hyperactivity. Compared to on-the-job learning, traditional education truncates critical thinking and slows learning.</li>
	<li>With on-the-job learning, an employee is often trained by a supervisor. If the supervisor tolerates the hyperactivity of the employee early on then the supervisor benefits from increased productivity later.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Traditional education fosters group-think as teachers are usually unwilling to fail an entire class for the same reason because this reflects poorly on the teacher.</li>
</ol>
Solutions include:
<ol>
	<li>Many-to-many learning or group learning. If group learning involves a facilitator it would be superior that the facilitator is a committee rather than an individual. Better yet, it could be a committee with student representation. Extending the committee into large, representative bodies is equivalent to many-to-many learning.</li>
	<li>Many-to-many learning. An example of this would be the MOOC industry. A particular MOOC would be like a one-to-many relationship, but as students are free to choose between teachers and courses it becomes a many-to-many relationship. The MOOC market allows generally affirmed teaching which is also taught in a desirable way to rise to the top.</li>
	<li>On-the-job learning, apprenticeships, and internships are great alternative forms of education which help ensure stake. Ph.D. learning may also involve more teacher stake compared to K-12, undergraduate, and Master's education.</li>
	<li>Student-driven learning and independent study may combat this negative effect.</li>
</ol>
Another thing I'd like to see more research on is competitive learning. Not as in neurology or information technology, but the kind of thing which occurs in the lead-up to student competitions and debates.

Such competitive learning may take place alongside gamification as well, if the game is structured in a competitive way. It would be interesting to research whether competitive games foster more learning than non-competitive gamified learning.
