Earlier today my friend John Taylor Hill told me about the new video from the makers of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y2KsU_dhwI\">\"180\"</a> called \"Evolution vs God.\"

My view is not one of evolution vs God. I find it very possible that they both exist. I am open to both old and young earth interpretations of the Genesis account in the Bible. Nonetheless the video is worth watching because it does a great job of covering some of the weaknesses in evolution. I don't think it does a great job of covering Intelligent Design. For that I job I would recommend Stephen Meyer's, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Doubt-Explosive-Origin-Intelligent/dp/0062071475\">\"Darwin's Doubt\"</a> or some of William Dembski's work.

Check out John Taylor Hill's <a href=\"http://jthmishmash.com/2013/08/07/watch-and-share-evolution-vs-god/\">article on the video here</a> and watch the video itself below:
