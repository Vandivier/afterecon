Today I read an article from a friend of mine entitled, \"<a href=\"http://raullopezblog.com/2013/02/17/minimum-wage-increase-the-debate-continues/#respond\">Minimum Wage Increase: The Debate Continues</a>.\"

I thought to myself, \"what an interesting title! I didn't realize anyone still thought the minimum wage was a defensible policy.\"

The article argued that the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Price elasticity of demand\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">price elasticity of demand</a> for labor is near 0 and therefore increasing the minimum wage, as long as we do it gradually so that we do not shock the markets too much, would benefit all.

While labor-demand elasticity is an interesting topic, and while it may be near 0, it is not 0. <a href=\"http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/118/4/1335.short\">Here</a>, as one example for proof of that statement,Â is a very good article published in 2003 from Oxford's <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" href=\"http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Quarterly Journal of Economics</a>, written by a Harvard economist and cited over 1200 times to back that statement up.

So the pro-<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Minimum wage\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">min wage</a> side may argue that the negative economic effect is \"small,\" but they cannot argue that it is 0. This is akin to saying we are only hurting poor people a little, which is quite different from saying we aren't hurting poor people.

The reality is that if a guy can't get a job when min wage is $6, it is all the more difficult for him when it gets bumped to $8 or $9. Consider the following video from the great organization LearnLiberty:

Lastly, have you considered the fact that a higher minimum wage creates an incentive for more \"under-the-table,\" or black market, transactions and illegal immigration?
