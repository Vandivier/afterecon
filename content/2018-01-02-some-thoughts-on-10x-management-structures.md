Explain 10x thinking <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC_PGHkRvTw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m50s\">per this video</a>.

ideas:
<ol>
 	<li>No pure manager role. Everyone has some technical skin in the game.</li>
 	<li>Pure managers as executive proxies
<ol>
 	<li>First, this seems a strict loss to technical efficiency, but maybe the exec is OK with that in exchange for sleep.</li>
 	<li>Second, does your manager even do this? If not, why do they exist?</li>
 	<li>Third, do they still need to be pure managers? or can they be technical managers and fill these shoes?</li>
 	<li>Fourth, something actionable: Make managers owners. That is, give them some</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Pure managers as project SMEs
<ol>
 	<li>I think some management roles exist because execs want a 'point person' on a project. Someone they can ping for updates, etc. There is absolutely no reason for this to be a pure management role.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Managers as business SMEs
<ol>
 	<li>Some managers exist because the technical staff doesn't know who to talk to with a non-technical question. For example, the technical staff works with the client to identify a new requirement and the client is willing to pay but this requires a contract modification, which is totally not a thing the developer knows how to do.</li>
 	<li>With proper digital infrastructure this role can be automated. The developer could look up a Contracts Team contact on an internal directory, or send an email to a help desk.</li>
 	<li>But, lacking digital infrastructure there may be a role for a dude, be that dude a guy or a girl, you know, a dude. A manager dude. But is he really a manager in this case? Like I don't think this is a project role so I wouldn't call it a project manager, and it doesn't seem a highly skilled role so I wouldn't dump management salary on it. It seems a horizonal-level, different skill specialty role. Like a business facilitator, or maybe a business intelligence role. Or maybe something else and idk the title.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
An alternative would be to replace many pure managers with a hybrid developer-manager role, such as a tech lead, which actually codes some portion of the time. In small firms this is actually very common. It might take the form of a lead developer who also handles running scrum. As firms scale there is surely a need to aggregate reporting and other such concerns, but why is this 1) not automated and 2) coupled to a management function? You can have a business intelligence specialist who collects metrics from a scrum team without pretending to command that team's direction.

bad manager characteristics: see strategic micromanagement and the ITW article.

also:
<ol>
 	<li>Insatiability: No matter how well you do you still aren't good enough. It may be a genuinely stupid manager who doesn't know how to identify talent, or it might be a strategically mean manager who thinks being an asshole or constantly threatening a firing is how you squeeze every once of productivity out of employees. But it isn't.</li>
 	<li>Appreciation failure: The manager doesn't \"get the message\" about either good news or bad news:
<ol>
 	<li>When a developer raises a concern, the manager glosses it over instead of acting to assist. \"OK thanks for the heads up, but I'm sure you can take care of it champ! You're the best!\"</li>
 	<li>When a developer (or group) executes some task with unexpected quality, the developer is either non-satiated (from 1) or otherwise unimpressed, or simply ignorant of the difficulty involved. \"Oh you guys knocked that out in an hour instead of a few days? Hm I guess you estimated it wrong, better work on that next time.\"</li>
 	<li>Often seen in non-technical managers. Technical managers don't usually have the same issue.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Lack of leadership
<ol>
 	<li>The leadership role is absolutely needed (whether or not you have a manager, you eventually get the leadership role from an exec or from the client)</li>
 	<li>The manager is the leader by default. If he can't handle it he should facilitate someone else leading on some particular task.</li>
 	<li>Leadership means providing priority among tasks for completion (should I work on A or B first?) and it also means identifying answers to business questions (should we go ahead and do A or do we need to check with the client, or should we just disregard the task?)</li>
 	<li>Bad leaders are indecisive, or worse yet cowardly and afraid to decide. This ends up wasting time and frustrating other staff.</li>
</ol>
