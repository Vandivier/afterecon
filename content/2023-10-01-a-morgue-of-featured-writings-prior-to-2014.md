<p>I have been writing on AfterEcon and elsewhere for over a decade. I recently went to update my <a href=\"https://www.afterecon.com/featured-writing/\">Media Curriculum Vitae</a>, which lists many of my non-academic works published to third parties, and I noticed some of my older remote posts belong to sites that have been disbanded.</p>

<p>This article simply lists those dead citations, so that they can live somewhere for historical purposes without taking up space on the Media CV itself. I think it's a poor user experience and personal brand impression for me to send someone my Media CV and the links are dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>I have a version of each of these four articles. I will post them to AfterEcon over the next few weeks and then retrospectively update this article to reference them. In some cases the version I have is a draft rather than the version that was finally published. I haven't checked, but I imagine the published form of each of these can be found in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
