This article goes over some \"math talk.\" That is, written language which is derived from symbols used in math, computer science or another technical written language.

When used in language, math talk may be expressing either a formal meaning or an informal meaning. The formal meaning would be the meaning of the symbol as used in a an actual math equation, an actual programming code and so on. The informal meaning would be the other meanings that the symbol may imply when it is not used in a formal setting. Some math talk is purely informal, meaning it is derived from a technical field, but if actually used in a formal way wouldn't make sense.

If you notice me saying anything randomly mathy that's not on here, please let me know and I will try to add it.
