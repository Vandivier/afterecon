</ol>
The subsequent article will refine the explanatory assignment using elasticities, similar to the deduction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incidence#Graphical_analysis\">tax incidence from elasticity</a>. Analysis in terms of elasticities allows an apples-to-apples comparison of similar events with different magnitudes. The total quantity explanation is easier to understand for the layman, but it is not very analytically useful.
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Gains to Utility from Preference Shift</strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It begins with an ordinary budget constraint and a utility curve, describing an individual according to the standard approach:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5757 size-large\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/johnsky-1-1024x680.png\" alt=\"johnsky-1\" width=\"605\" height=\"402\" /></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At some time the individual's preference function is modified such that the demand for Y is multiplied by 10/X.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Notice that this is an exponential change. If the shifter had been a constant multiplier, the individual would ultimately select the same basket, albeit with a different level of utility. We could have altered the relative preference with a constant shifter, but that seems inappropriate since it would entail utility in some good even without consumption of any quantity of that good. An exponential shifter seems to be the only appropriate way to denote a change in relative preference, without which utility may fluctuate, but not in a way discernible from changes to quantities demanded.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here the Preference-Substitution Effect is demonstrated. The individual substitutes 10Y for 20Y, while maintaining a constant level of utility. This is possible now that the individual values each unit of X more highly.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5758 size-large\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/johnsky-2-1024x689.png\" alt=\"johnsky-2\" width=\"605\" height=\"407\" /></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Having substituted 10Y for 20Y, the individual is now below their budget constraint.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By shifting their own preferences, the result is as if the individual had received additional income. This individual is now free to consume additional units according to their new utility function.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here the Preference-Income Effect is demonstrated. The individual shifts the new utility curve outward in parallel fashion until a tangent bundle is observed and consumed.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Notice that this entails a gain to utility by the fact that the individual has increased the quantities consumed of both goods in comparison to the optimal basket affected only by substitution.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5756 size-large\" src=\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/johnsky-4-1024x672.png\" alt=\"johnsky-4\" width=\"605\" height=\"397\" /></p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Simultaneous Price and Preference Shift</strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first thing to note about simultaneous change in price and preference is that they do interact, and they can completely offset one another.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The easiest way for this demonstration to occur is to let the change in price exactly entail the absence of a Preference-Income Effect. We can refer to the most recently used image and see that this would be represented as a simultaneous 25% increase in the price of both X and Y.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One might be tempted to say, then, that preferences alone explain the shift down, and the price change serves no purpose except to preclude the preference-income effect. I would propose that a better analysis identifies only the absence of a classic substitution effect, due to the parallel shift in the budget constraint, with explanatory contributions from the other 3 effects possibly involved, even though two of them offset one another.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The preference-substitution effect explains a total decrease in consumption of 10Y, the preference-income effect explains an increase in consumption of about 6.47Y and 3.53X, the ordinary income effect exactly negates the preference-income effect, and there is no substitution effect.</p>
