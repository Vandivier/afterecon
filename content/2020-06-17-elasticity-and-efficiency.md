<p>Does the concept of economic mobility from a firm perspective contradict the notion of robustness implying efficiency?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is, if firms are rapidly and elastically created, used, and destroyed for short-term purposes, should we consider them inefficient?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems to me that elastic firm dynamics, where a firm is rapidly created, utilized, and destroyed, are a beneficial and specialized firm form, not an anti-pattern as some institutional economics claims seems to imply.</p>

<p>Programmer pro tip: This is directly analogous to elastic scaling or autoscaling of EC2s and other resources. These technologies and implementation patterns greatly improve overall application technical efficiency and computing cost. Shouldn't they analogically do the same in the overall economy?</p>
