<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Everyone knows I'm a big fan of the economist Ludwig von Mises. One great thing is that nearly everything Mises ever wrote is available for free online. But what's always frustrated me was the fact that there was no single, complete, comprehensive source that collected all of Mises's works for easy searching and reference.<br><br>So I decided to create it myself. It is 7900 pages and 220 MB. Enjoy.</p></blockquote>
