Or, Austrian (Economic) Sociology

Because of the infatuation of Austrian economics and process, in particular for application, the Austrian needs to specifically observe and likely engage (for tacit understanding) in the process to be modeled.

Also, ABM helps. The Austrian Business Economist should be one part ethnographer one part coder one part economist.
