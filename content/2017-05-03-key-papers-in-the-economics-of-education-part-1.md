<ol>
 	<li>This brief editor's page highlights the importance of <a href=\"http://www.unl.edu/dber/what-dber\">discipline-based education research</a>. I'd never heard of such a thing before, so I deem it an important find.</li>

<ol>
 	<li>Not a particularly awesome article, but it got me thinking: In a market society we handle the 'worst producers' via charity, where is the equivalent in our education system?</li>
 	<li>I think the answer is the equivalent is the 'group project,' but these are rare. The usual rule is \"don't work together, that's cheating.\" I think this penalizes the least educated.</li>
 	<li>Not allowing students to work together removes the possibility of academic charity (some kids helping less educated) but it also removes the <a href=\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/short-essay-regarding-samaritans-dilemmas-wealth-redistribution-polycentricity/\">possibility of reciprocity</a>, reducing the desire of the less educated student to improve, creating a lock-in effect.</li>
