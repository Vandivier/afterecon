Lately the following video has been going around the internet:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bntfUA6TmLs

The lady in the video basically thinks Monster Energy Drinks are somehow in the interest of Satan. <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/monster666.asp\">This Snopes article says they aren't</a>. I'm not convinced by either party, but I wanted to make a couple points missed out on by the Snopes article and one important point missed out on by the lady. Also, Snopes is garbage anyway. They make incorrect assessments all the time and one of these days I might just do an article specifically against them, but that is not the point here.

Snopes acknowledged three of the lady's key points:
<ol>
	<li>The \"M\" in monster looks kind of like 666 in Hebrew.</li>
	<li>The \"O\" in monster has a cross on it.</li>
	<li>The text on the Monster sales material brags that MILFs like Monster, so it is not a Christian organization.</li>
</ol>
Snopes argues that this is not valid for the following reasons:
<ol>
	<li>The \"M\" may look like the Hebrew \"6\" repeated 3 times, but this does not make it 666, which would look different as the Hebrew six hundred and sixty six.</li>
	<li>The \"O\" with the cross in it is a greek phi, which has nothing to do with Christianity.</li>
	<li>Point not addressed.</li>
</ol>
My response to the Snopes points:
<ol>
	<li>Repeating 6 three times is enough to make suspicion reasonable. Symbolism is not about mathematical or grammatical precision.</li>
	<li>First, it does look like phi. However, phi does look like an \"O\" with a cross in it. On the other hand, referencing the cross is not by any means a devilish activity. Finally, the greek letter phi is distantly related to Christianity in the following way:
<ol>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.evolutionnews.org/2014/12/do_we_live_in_a091611.html\">Phi represents the Golden Ratio and the Golden Ratio may be an example of fine-tuning and therefore an indicator of design.</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-30.htm\">In the Bible, Jesus says, \"Whoever is not with me is against me.\"</a> By bragging about MILFs, Monster has already indicated organic unity with the Devil.</li>
</ol>
My additional points:
<ol>
	<li>The lady didn't bring this up and it might be because it seems so obvious to her as a Christian that she didn't realize other people wouldn't know, but \"the Beast\" is biblical language for the Devil. \"Monster\" can also reference the Devil. The beast or monster inside of a person refers to their sinful nature, which is also related to the Devil. Monster's name and motto, \"Unleash the Beast,\" imply devilish sympathy to many Christians prima facie.</li>
	<li>Coca-Cola owns Monster and is a large-dollar donor to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3AAW3pgayY\">Bilderberg Group</a>, as per the video below. The Bilderberg Group is a group of elite individuals and largely considered a major driver of the New World Order. I won't get too into the details here, because they are in large part debated, but many view the New World Order as in support of, directly or indirectly, the devil, and opposed to, directly or indirectly, Christianity.</li>
</ol>

I conclusion I'm not convinced that there is any conscious effort behind Monster Energy Drink to support activities in favor of the Devil or opposed to Christianity, but it remains a possibility. Perhaps more importantly, the organization need not conduct such activity with intention for it to conduct such activity in effect. Jesus said if you are not for him then you are against him. I believe this is true, and I think one interpretation of this is that non-Christian organizations will end up de facto supporting the Devil even if they didn't intend to do so.
