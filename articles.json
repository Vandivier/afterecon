    "content": "Look, the scientific community at large needs to cut the crap. Here is a video from a YouTube channel that I love. Usually this channel does a great job of breaking complex concepts down into short, but still super entertaining, videos. Take a listen and you will hear a well produced and illustrated version of what the general scientific community typically says about evolution:\\n\\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3GagfbA2vo&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]\\n\\nWasn't that great? What could be wrong with that? What on earth do I mean by cut the crap?\\n\\nHere's what I mean. Click back to the :26 mark on the video. \\\"Evolution, it's a thing, it's not a debate.\\\" This is what many in the scientific community constantly say, but they are flat wrong. They dodge the debate by pretending it doesn't exist, but the debate does indeed exist, and it has been making the scientific community look more and more foolish over the years. In the video Hank himself admits that only 40% of the population of America believes that evolution is a real thing!\\n\\nCheck all the statistics available and you will find that American's distrust of the scientific community at large is at an all time high. Why? For 4 reasons: First, there exists a disgusting culture and psychological mindset amongst scientists and academics in general, including Hank in this video. Those of this culture and mindset genuinely believe that they know everything and those without their particular view are uneducated or just plain fucking stupid. Click on the 1:19 mark of the above video for a perfect example of exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\nThis reasoning also explains why many academics and scientists are comfortable claiming that no evolution debate exists. They have all of the answers already! They would rather work on something new and interesting than \\\"waste time\\\" looking back at something they have already answered. Because, you know, being the geniuses they are they couldn't possibly have answered incorrectly the first time. The idea of revision or double-checking is seen simply as an unnecessary wasting of time.\\n\\nThen there are also those more malignant types who flat out know they are wrong. They act out of selfishness or in defense of their own reputation or ideology rather than the simple foolishness of an inflated and impatient ego. They act as if giving real standing to the evolution debate would be unnecessary while knowing full well that granting such standing would be the intellectually honest thing to do.\\n\\nThey choose this strategy in order to agree with those of the other camp which makes their numbers seem larger and more unified in reasoning, or else they act as if giving such standing is something so stupid as to be laughable or even insulting! Why would it even be considered insulting? Because it might represent a questioning of their infallible, superior, mainstream scientific analysis! That, of course, is exactly what the view alternative to evolution is, and that questioning is made on purpose and with good cause. A real scientists would never be insulted by the presentation of an alternative explanation.\\n\\nThere are only very few scientists with the ability to resist these selfish psychosocial forces and actually acknowledge the fact that there is a legitimate debate. Even fewer can stomach the reality that once the arguments are objectively considered, evolution is loosing the debate.\\n\\nThe recognition of those negative psychosocial forces in academia and many of the fields of science leads many common people to distrust the analysis of those people. They could just be telling you whatever makes them look good rather than what is actually true!\\n\\nThere is another very similar social force at work, but it is not a psychological one. As the saying goes, \\\"Follow the money.\\\" This cultural force exists due to the fact that many scientists and academic researchers are paid by political or corporate interests. They will produce biased research to further corporate or political or other interests, rather than pursuing the truth. This bias extends even into the camp of the opposition of the mainstream!\\n\\nIt is well known that the opposition of the mainstream is overrepresented by those with strong religious views. Without a doubt this religious motivation is a factor. A balanced analysis of the mainstream and alternative work, however, has shown that the opposition to the mainstream, at least in the field of evolution, is objectively justified and valid.\\n\\nBesides the emotional and cultural issues remain 2 real scientific issues. The mainstream has drawn bad and unscientific conclusions with regard to climate change and theories of evolution. Such bad conclusions that even a non-expert can tell the mainstream views on those items are bullshit. When someone gives you bullshit and tells you it's true you begin to distrust them. Altogether these 4 forces contribute significantly to the distrust of the mainstream scientific community on a rational basis. Not a basis of a lack of education or a presence of education combined with a lack of intelligence.\\n\\nNotice again in the video how Hank (the speaker) talks about \\\"evolution.\\\" He says, \\\"It's a thing,\\\" but if anyone asks, \\\"Hey, what is evolution?\\\" There answer will inevitably depend on context. Hank defines evolution at the 1:53 mark saying, \\\"Evolution is just the idea that gene distribution changes over time.\\\"\\n\\nThis is flatly untrue. Not only does evolution play differently in the different fields of science such as social evolution and cultural evolution, even within biology there are several distinct kinds of evolution. Without further specification \\\"evolution\\\" usually refers to macro-evolution. However not only did Hank incorrectly define macro-evolution, there are several other versions of evolution as well! Lastly, macro-evolution is not proven through any documented scientific method, nor any logically consistent deductive method either. Micro-evolution has been documented.\\n\\nThis is a trick evolutionists play. They will claim \\\"evolution has been proven.\\\" They will then show evidence for micro-evolution, and then go on to presume the validity of the clearly distinct macro-evolution. More on this later.\\n\\nThere is macro-evolution, micro-evolution, natural selection, and at least 4 other distinct forms of evolution, all analyzed in great detail by Kent Hovind in the video below, but not even addressed by most science teachers that I have ever had. Below is a video from Hovind where he discusses issues with and alternatives to modern \\\"scientific\\\" teachings on evolution as well as various other \\\"lies in the textbooks\\\" from the various sciences. If you don't want to watch the whole thing than just watch the first 35 minutes:\\n\\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8GgrUposII&amp;w=420&amp;h=315]\\n\\nBack to the evolution video. Of course he claims that life originated 3.8 billion years ago. He doesn't bother to mention all the evidence we have that such a number is completely unrealistic, nor does he mention the wealth of issues addressing the dating of fossils and layers of rock, etc, as mentioned in Hovind's video. Suffice it to say that evolution, if true, depends on the truth of an \\\"Old Earth\\\" and, while an \\\"Old Earth\\\" seems plausible according to most modern evidence, it is far from a debate free topic. Also he says that the similarities of bone structures implies a common descent. Is it just me or is he assuming his own conclusion? That statement, made without evidence, is so biased it makes me want to laugh.\\n\\nYet the issue with evolution is not simply that it has problems. The naysayers are not just picking a fight without suggesting a viable alternative. In fact the naysayers, including ID pioneer William Dembski, have an alternative explanation to evolution which is able to statistically explain absurdly larger amounts of the information we see around us than evolution is able to. Much like the difference between going on a blind date or dating someone you have known for a long time, having a better explanation causes evolution to look even worse due to the opportunity cost of understanding of choosing a worse explanation. Listen to William Dembski below as he explains some of what the science of Intelligent Design entials in contrast with what evolution lacks:\\n\\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQwAWv41sU&amp;w=420&amp;h=315]\\n\\nThat's where I'll end this episode of liberal ass kicking. Come back and see me for some more real soon.",

    "title": "5 Ways to Save Money Through Logistical Cost Reduction",
    "date": "2013-01-13",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article will be about 5 ways to save money. Is the lease on your apartment up soon? Are you considering buying a vehicle?<br /><br />These and other topics will be dealt with here because good decisions in these areas will all help to reduce something called your logistical expenditure, which is a fancy way of saying how much it costs you to go places such as commuting from home to work.<br /><br />#1 Buy Used Vehicles<br />According to Dave Ramsey, the average car loses 70% of its value in 4 years. Looking at this a different way, this statistic indicates that if you wait until a car is 4 years old you can purchase it for 70% off! Additionally, many of the manufacturer problems in a car will have already surfaced by the 4 year mark. Make sure you do your homework though! Here is a video to help you dodge some of the tricky parts of buying used:<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh_zWsQWWA8&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]<br /><br />#2 Get a Vehicle With Higher Gas Mileage<br />I'm not about going green, but I am about saving green. If a car gets 20 mpg, like mine, finding another car with 40 mpg is like cutting your gas bill in half! I spend about $10 per day on gas due to my work commute. If I only spent $5 per day I would be saving about $70 per pay period (every two weeks for me), about $150 per month, or about $1800 per year! Make sure that the maintenance costs on your car do not outweigh the savings in mpg cost though! I hate to say it, but alot of Asian (Nissan, Mazda) are a win-win in this trade, saving both in maintenance cost, mpg cost, and also often cheaper to begin with!<br /><br />#3 Move Closer to Your Destination<br />If you commute to work or school, consider living closer to that destination. I commute 30 miles to and from work each day. That is over an hour of wasted time and also about $10 in gas each and every day. If I lived 10 miles from work I would only waste about 20 minutes per day and about $3-$4 per trip. The same is true for those of us how commute to school regularly!<br /><br />#4 Like, Really Close to the Destination...Walking/Biking Distance<br />If you live within 1-3 miles of your destination you can simply walk, bike, or skate there! This not only saves time and gas money but also upkeep costs on your vehicle! Vehicle repair can be very expensive as we all know. <a href=\\\"http://auto.howstuffworks.com/under-the-hood/cost-of-car-ownership/auto-maintenance-cost.htm\\\">According to one source</a>, the average American family spent about $400 per year per car on maintenance and about $600 per year on car insurance. Not to mention the bonus to your health of exercise!<br /><br />#5 Move Work Closer to You<br />This is pretty much the same as #3 and #4 but at the same time opposite. Instead of moving toward work, get a new job closer to you! Considering that I waste an hour of time each day (time is money) and $10 of gas per round trip going to my job which has an average shift length of 8 hours and pay per hour of $10 I could actually take a job (if such a job existed) where I walked across the block and only earned $8.10 per hour and actually earn more per hour! How? In the first case I am spending 10 \\\"hour equivalents\\\" per day:<br /><br />8 hours work + 1 hour drive time (I could be working and earning) + $10 gas =<br />10 Hour equivalent yielding $80 income b/c 8 hours actual work * $10/hr wage =<br />daily adjusted wage of $8 per hour.<br /><br />In the second case, assuming the same shift lengths:<br />8 hours work + 0 hours drive + 0 hours equivalent due to gas = 8 Hour equivalent yielding $64.8 income b/c (same reason as first case). Daily adjusted wage of $8.1 per hour.<br /><br />So as you can see I would be earning less but spending so much less that I would actually come out ahead! Considering factors like these will help you be a better steward of your money! These factors include logistical costs and opportunity costs!",

    "title": "A Short Recommendation and Defense of Homeschooling",
    "date": "2013-02-09",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "The case for homeschooling is simple:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>It produces superior results compared to public or even private schooling in virtually every statistically normalized study ever done.<a href=\\\"http://www.hslda.org/docs/news/200908100.asp\\\"> Here's one comprehensive study.</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li>It achieves those results for a tiny sliver of the cost.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Technology has advanced to the point that anyone can homeschool. Anyone.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>It encourages personal responsibility and discourages powerful centralized government.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nTwo common objections are usually posed. Neither is valid:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>It is said that homeschoolers are socially awkward. This is not borne out in the studies nor in theory. While homeschoolers are usually educated in small groups they also usually form local networks with other homeschoolers and a social community is created.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>It is objected that parents are not suitable teachers. This objection is raised for a variety of sub-reasons, however, again, the statistics do not validate this accusation. As it turns out in reality, as opposed to the complex imagination of the critics, parents make pretty damn good teachers in most cases. In the cases where they don't three points should be considered:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Home-schooling doesn't necessarily a child's own parents teaching their own child in their own home. While this is often the case, it is also exceedingly common for churches or other charitable organizations to set up pseudo-schools which are permitted as home schools or for parents to form networks of friends and let their child be homeschooled by a homeschooling cooperative of other adults. Finally, with modern technology, homeschooling materials of exceptional accuracy, quality and power are available widely and cheaply, often freely, via the internet. Course offering unavailable even in many large high schools are available through some of these programs!</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Those kids with horrible parents which would presumably make horrible teachers don't actually have much to lose - they are already failing out of school and not learning! The sad reality is that kids with a bad home life are horrible students even in the most optimal conditions - ask anyone who has done real research into comparative education systems. On the other hand it is much cheaper to have them fail at home than to fail going to a state sponsored school.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Actually the statistics indicate that home-schooling might be good even for those \\\"horrible parents\\\" and \\\"horrible students\\\" such as the poor and mentally ill. As previously mentioned, charitable and religious institutions often have outreach programs for these groups and they seem to work much better than the public school solution. Here is a video of a southern home-school cooperative for poor blacks, one which has had great success:</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR_k227Ilbs&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion I fully and honestly support a home-schooling mandate to replace k-12 school alongside elimination of the Dept. of Education. I also favor elimination of state sponsored higher education which will lead to better higher education and certification schemes.",

    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "J Warner Wallace gave his talk tonight. My wife reported on the talk live for The Houstonian, SHSU's school paper. She used a cool bit of technology called CoveritLive which allowed her to take notes and post them live as the presentation progressed. The notes are recorded <a href=\\\"http://www.houstonianonline.com/a-e/cold-case-christian-speaks-at-shsu-live-event-1.2822207#.UWTW0qIcdBE\\\">here</a>.<br /><br />Some of the highlights include:<br />-Two main branches of apologetics are evidentialist and presuppositional. Wallace specializes in evidentialist apologetics.<br />-Cold cases are run off of indirect evidence, also called circumstantial evidence.<br />-Something may be \\\"possible\\\" but not \\\"reasonable.\\\"<br />-Christianity can be argued to be reasonable, or true beyond reasonable doubt.<br />-Circumstantial evidence can build a case beyond a reasonable doubt.<br />-Circumstantial evidence and direct evidence are the only two kinds of evidence. Sometimes indirect is preferable because, for example, an eyewitness may lie.<br />-Luke wrote Acts before the destruction of the temple and did not mention the deaths of James or Paul. This indicates he wrote Acts prior to 60 AD, when James was martyred because he would not have failed to mention such a great event, seeing as how he records the deaths of much less influential others.<br />-Acts is Luke's second book. By the time of the writing of Acts, the book of Luke is already seen as mainline Christian scripture. If Acts was written in 60 AD then Luke would have been written about 53 AD (his estimate, other reasons too.)<br />-Luke was based on Mark, which was written even earlier. Mark is argued to have been written in the 40s AD. This makes the original Gospel very early and therefore reliably eyewitness, not simply recounting.<br /><br />Wallace argued that the Apostles were present, verified, accurate and unbiased. The following video is part of the same talk but given at a different time and location. His talking points and the slides used are nearly the same ones we saw though:<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUpXpwoGlfI&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]<br /><br /><br />Be sure to check out <a href=\\\"http://pleaseconvinceme.com/\\\">his website</a>, the <a href=\\\"http://www.str.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=7973\\\">Stand to Reason website</a> whom he is partnered with, and <a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/\\\">his book's website!</a>",

    "title": "The Coming Litecoin Explosion",
    "date": "2013-04-26",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<a href=\\\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9238677/Mt._Gox_delays_plan_to_support_virtual_currency_litecoin\\\">Computer World</a> and <a href=\\\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/potent-ddos-attacks-on-mt-gox-delays-rollout-of-new-virtual-currency/\\\">Ars Technica</a> both recently ran stories based on <a href=\\\"https://mtgox.com/pdf/20130424_ddos_statement_and_faq.pdf\\\">a recent Mt Gox official statement</a>. The statement was regarding a series of DDoS attacks which Mt Gox has been undergoing as of late. The statement significantly acknowledged that Mt Gox had been planning to support litecoin trade and such plans had been postponed due to the attention shift toward security interests.<br /><br />Litecoin is a cryptocurrency based on an altered bitcoin protocol with significant improvements adding real value. The mining protocol is based on scrypt rather than SHA256. Scrypt is best mined with GPU power which is consumer-grade. This makes litecoin a more \\\"democratic\\\" currency, and allows it to fulfill the cryptocurrency's necessary trait of a widely distributed network, at least for the short and mid terms, better than bitcoin.<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://thegenerallifeblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/3-reasons-why-i-now-like-litecoin.html\\\">In this article</a> I go over some other things which give litecoin intrinsic value and even a competitive advantage. Here is a chart graphing Litecoin search interest by Google:<br /><br /><a href=\\\"http://imgur.com/V1DuQnn\\\"><img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/V1DuQnn.png\\\" title=\\\"Hosted by imgur.com\\\" /></a><br /><br />Interesting that so many Russians are searching ltc ;)<br /><br />In the long run by the quantity theory of money, assuming litecoin and bitcoin can function equally well, litecoin should have a value of .25BTC. This is because there will be a total of 4 times as many litecoins ever produced as bitcoins ever produced. However in the short to mid-term, litcoin will be significantly more valuable by the same quantity analysis because currently the ratio is closer to <a href=\\\"http://ltc.block-explorer.com/charts\\\">17LTC</a> for each <a href=\\\"https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins\\\">11BTC</a> and the equalization process takes the course of several years as it is determined by each coin mining its maximum number of coins, which takes many years.<br /><br />This would yield a short term price of 11BTC/17LTC which very slowly approaches .25BTC/LTC over many years. However this does not account for the non-quantitative qualities. As I have previously argued litecoin is fundamentally superior to bitcoin. How much superior? That is the question. I have no idea. Perhaps that is a topic for another article.<br /><br />However, presuming LTC&gt;BTC this implies that BTC will be valued at LTC&gt;BTC&gt;0. From a statistically ignorant point of view the 50% mark is the best choice. Therefore I will presume that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is .5 the intrinsic value of litecoin. Note that I am not talking about individual coins here, but rather the entire system.<br /><br />We multiply the expected intrinsic value of the whole litecoin system (2xBTC) by the expected quantity value per coin and we find the expected value per litecoin is 22BTC/17LTC slowly approaching .5BTC/LTC. There is one other problem with this analysis: Economic infrastructure. The litecoin economic infrastructure is a joke compared to the BTC infrastructure and we all know how hard it is to grow that BTC infrastructure. However! Litecoin processing is almost identical to bitcoin processing. What this means is that given a particular business has decided to use bitcoin it should be very easy to convince them to use litecoin! In fact, litecoin and bitcoin fluidly and quickly exchange with one another. I expect in the mid-term the LTC infrastructure will become insignificantly different from that of BTC, but that is not in the short term, rendering the short-term valuation incorrect.<br /><br />What is the market value now? Yesterday it was .022LTC/BTC. <a href=\\\"https://vircurex.com/\\\">Today it is .027LTC/BTC.</a> Let's say LTC only ever grows to .5BTC/LTC and never gets that mid-term bump we expect by the quantity theory. This would still be over a 15xROI!! That's 15000%!<br /><br />I expect the Mt Gox trading of litecoin will begin this trend and I expect the flood of ASICs in BTC mining this summer will supplement this trend. To be more specific, I expect Mt Gox to begin LTC trade and a significant number of ASICs to be shipped by August 2013 resulting in an exchange rate at least .15BTC/LTC by August 31.<br /><br />Other people are also calling for the litecoin jump:<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcB4lfUWXEE&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]<br /><br />His expectation is USD which is not entirely consistent with mine. Right now 1LTC = 3.8 USD so he is basically expecting a little over 600% ROI from fiat. My prediction would be that as LTC rises relative to BTC, BTC is still rising relative to fiat. <a href=\\\"http://thegenerallifeblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/yet-another-bitcoin-article-very-quick.html\\\">I have predicted elsewhere</a> that by December we will have seen a $264 BTC. That would mean about 176% of today's value (range today, April 25, 140-160). So in fiat I suppose I am predicting about 176%(.15/.022)= 1200% ROI, or about double what this other guy is expecting. At least we are in the same direction, but I don't hear alot of numbers in his analysis so I think mine's a little better ;)<br /><br />People called me crazy when I called BTC. Now I am calling LTC. Come get your money.",

    "title": "Misdiagnosing the God of the Gaps",
    "date": "2013-05-13",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "There is a gap in the knowledge of each and every person and there always will be. The gap extends directly from the human condition in a number of ways at least consisting of human nature's imperfect ability to ascertain, process and retain information.<br /><br />Other sources of the gap may exist as well, including some which I haven't mentioned because the knowledge of those limits itself lays in the gap. This gap is ironically demonstrated by the improvement of our knowledge rather than direct observation of the thing of which we are ignorant.<br /><br />When Louis Pasteur invented pasteurization the resulting efficiency illustrated the fact that a particular gap had existed prior. Some of the brighter minds of the time would have known their limits and said, \\\"We don't know why milk spoils.\\\" They would not have said, \\\"We don't yet know about bacteria,\\\" at least with the term 'bacteria' meaning anything beyond the unknown cause of milk spoilage. If used in that context perhaps 'bacteria' would only mean something milk itself does rather than the name of an external agent. No one would have known prior to the appropriate verification of some theory such as the germ theory.<br /><br />Theists have often been accused of invoking a <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps\\\">God of the Gaps</a>. It is true that our ignorance cannot be used to prove God exists, but it is equally fallacious to conclude that our ignorance discredits God's existence. There is a related fallacy discussed by Dembski:<br /><br />“Scientists rightly resist invoking the supernatural in scientific explanations for fear of committing a god-of-the-gaps fallacy (the fallacy of using God as a stop-gap for ignorance). Yet without some restriction on the use of chance, scientists are in danger of committing a logically equivalent fallacy - one we may call the “chance-of-the-gaps fallacy.” Chance, like God, can become a stop-gap for ignorance.” <br />― <a href=\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/101108.William_A_Dembski\\\">William A. Dembski</a><br /><br />Certainly the logical progression from I don't know what the cause is to therefore God exists is fallacious, however indirect reasoning is often misdiagnosed as God of the Gaps reasoning. One form of indirect reasoning would be:<br /><br />1 A exists.<br />2 A fits the explanatory pattern of B.<br />3 Therefore, B may explain A.<br /><br />If I can demonstrate that B explains A better than B', or better than competing explanations, B is a justified belief, although not necessarily true. This is not an argument from ignorance, another name for the gap fallacies such as the God of the Gaps argument. See the video below for Dinesh D'souza's more in-depth and in-context discussion of the misdiagnosis of indirect reasoning as an argument from ignorance:<br /><br />[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-nzLpyJJHM&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]<br /><br />Indirect reasoning is valid. Even mainstream science is based on indirect reasoning. See the section entitled \\\"Fuel for the Fire\\\" near the bottom of the first page of <a href=\\\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/05/20/brian-greene-welcome-to-the-multiverse.html\\\">this article</a> for an example of indirect reasoning being used for mainstream science.<br /><br />In conclusion all people are necessarily subject to the Great Gap. Ignorance cannot support any form of position or it is not real ignorance, but indirect reasoning doesn't constitute the real ignorance of the gap and is justified in use.",

    "title": "God's Will as Objective Utility and Interpretive Proof",
    "date": "2013-06-10",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Under traditional economics utility is subjective. Under CAE we discern between personal and objective utility. Personal utility is classical economic utility or personal preference. Objective utility is defined in two ways and the two ways will always yield the same result.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first definition of objective utility is the subjective preference of the objective reference frame, God. The second definition of objective utility comes from the idea that there is a perfect allocation of all things.\\r\\n\\r\\nA perfect allocation of all things entails more than simply an efficient resource allocation. With highest relevance, a perfect allocation of all things would entail that the preferences of all individuals have been ideally configured.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a perfect allocation of all things were to be achieved then the subjective utilities of all individuals would be equivalent to their objective utilities. As a result, all aggregate market demands would be at their morally ideal values. Finally, the emergent price equilibria in such markets would be the set of objective values or prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummarily, CAE establishes the existence of intrinsic value where the intrinsic value of a good may be defined equivalently in the following two ways:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>God's willingness to pay for a good.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The market price for a good when microeconomic demand is the optimized result of a function of efficiency and objective moral considerations.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThe assertion of the equivalence of these two definitions is a fundamental identity claim of CAE. The assertion may be called the Invisible Hand Axiom and stated this way:\\r\\n\\r\\nReality will self-optimize in the long run and this self-optimized state reflects the will of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nA key theory in CAE is that beliefs and preferences are choices conducted at the individual level as a function of an environmental effect and a volitional or spiritual factor of identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsistent with this hypothesis, it is hypothesized that market forces act to incentivize the structure of individual and social beliefs and moral preferences in the same way such market forces are observed to influence other individual and social behavioral choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is finally expected that markets will tend toward moral efficiency in the same way that markets tend toward utilitarian and productive efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne notable component of the theory of dynamic moral optimization is the expectation for improvements in scriptural interpretation over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral points may be worth highlighting:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>CAE is a post-free market economic discipline. Many of the requirements for <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Free market\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">free market flourishing</a> are dependencies for the theory of dynamic moral optimization.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Taking after the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Austrian School\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Austrian School</a> and the related fields of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxeology\\\">Praxeology</a> and <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymology\\\">Thymology</a>, CAE leverages the concept of teleology and axiomatic logic to produce action axioms, or contingent action recommendations.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>In CAE the Church is viewed as a market comprised of Christians.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>There is an Apparent Church which is the aggregation of all people professing Christian identity and there is the Real Church which is comprised of those people who are actually Christians.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The Real Church is theorized to persist in the long run, while the Apparent Church is theorized to shut down in the long run. There is a notable theological similarity between the economics of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_%28economics%29\\\">firm shutdown</a> and the <a href=\\\"http://www.truthaccordingtoscripture.com/documents/death/perish.php#.VmUckL_-3Hg\\\">theology of perishing</a>.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>There is an obvious identification difficulty for empirical work.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Lastly are the two concepts of the human condition and interpretive proof.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nAnother named assertion is called the Human Condition Axiom and consists of the following claim:\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividuals necessarily have an imperfect ability to ascertain, process, retain, and act upon information.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Real Church is expected to approach a correct interpretation of scripture in the long run, it is not expected that an individual will ever be able to achieve perfect understanding of God, scripture, natural reality, or anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the human condition, individuals should seek to improve understanding and ability. Individuals have some innate understanding and ability, and they may grow these competencies to great personal and social benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CAE framework offers the interpretive proof which is a tool intended to improve scriptural interpretation. Consistent with what has just been mentioned, the execution of an interpretive proof doesn't entail the truth of the proven interpretation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is merely hypothesized that an interpretation of scripture for which there is a valid interpretive proof is less likely to be fallacious than an interpretation of scripture which is rejected under the method of interpretive proof.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interpretive proof is simply one method of interpretation and it is recommended for use alongside other hermeneutic methods. In my next post I will do an example proof but in this post I will explain how it works. The interpretation is proven when it \\\"comes full circle.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interpretation is said to have come full circle when it is taken from observation and verified by observation, although the same observations needn't, and perhaps shouldn't in order to avoid circular reasoning, be used. Let's say I want to prove that a proper interpretation of Christianity is that we should pursue traditional marriage. On the one hand I can look at countries around the world and see that they have superior economies when they have a prevalence of traditional marriage. This is a one-handed proof and it provides evidence that traditional marriage is a component of a superior economy. The superiority demonstrates something of God's will. God's will is that reality be allocated more like a traditional marriage-based society than like the average society. When we provide evidence for a characteristic of the optimized reality, and that characteristic is advocated by a particular morality, we say that we have a \\\"left-handed proof\\\" of God's will being in accordance with a particular morality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be noticed that claiming God's will is consistent with personal morality is related to <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Divine command theory\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_command_theory\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Divine Command Theory</a>, the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Problem of evil\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Epicurean Paradox</a>, and a variety of other topics. Those discussions are for another time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile a left-handed proof is based on secular data, a \\\"right-handed proof\\\" is based on observation of exclusively Christian sources. Reading the Bible is one example of observing an exclusively Christian source. If we come up with an explanatory interpretation using the Bible then we have a \\\"right-handed\\\" interpretation. In order to verify that interpretation we must test it against the left hand and against extra-biblical data.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the left handed interpretation is consistent with the right handed interpretation we have completed a CAE Interpretive Proof. I will conduct an example of such a proof in my next post.",

    "title": "This Juneteenth, Let's Discuss the Real History of Rascism",
    "date": "2013-06-20",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth\\\">Juneteenth,</a> also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, is a holiday in the United States that commemorates the announcement of the abolition of slavery in the U.S. state of Texas in 1865.\\n\\nThis is a Texan thing and we Texans better know our own history. Furthermore this story highlights principals and historical trends which are important in the larger American context and around the world. Juneteenth is now celebrated in 42 of the states and even in some foreign countries! Yet we still don't understand the story.\\n\\nIn 1865 Texas was controlled by racists. Just a little while earlier, though, it hadn't been.\\n\\nNot that acceptable kind of awareness of the correlation of certain statistics to race inside of a particular causal situation, rather, I mean the out-and-out, \\\"Niggers ain't really people\\\" kind of senseless and bigoted racism that haunts the history of America. How did Texas get this way?\\n\\nLet's remember how <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_houston#Republic_of_Texas\\\">Sam Houston helped Texas gain independence in 1836</a>. Sam Houston embodied everything that was Texas from its founding. First he signed the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Declaration_of_Independence\\\">Texas Declaration of Independance</a>, then he became Commander-in-Chief of Texas, then he whipped Santa Anna by the grace of God when all odds were against him in <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto\\\">San Jacinto</a>, then he became the President of Texas. Later, after the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Annexation\\\">Annexation of Texas</a>, Houston became the first Texan Senator in the US Senate, then was elected as Governor of Texas.\\n\\nHere is the part where everything that is usually taught gets turned upside down - Houston was not racist. Selected excerpts from, \\\"<a href=\\\"http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/bios/houston/sam_houston.html\\\">Sam Houston</a>\\\" by Thomas H. Krenek, reads:\\n\\n\\\"As senator, Houston emerged as an ardent Unionist...He stridently opposed the rising sectionalism of the antebellum period and delivered eloquent speeches on the issue. A supporter of the 1820 Missouri Compromise...Houston voted in 1848 for the Oregon Bill prohibiting the \\\"peculiar institution\\\" in that territory, a vote proslavery Southerners later held against him...Houston again clashed with his old nemesis who led the proslavery forces when he opposed John C. Calhoun's Southern Address in 1849...He incurred the permanent wrath of proslavery elements by supporting the Compromise of 1850, a series of measures designed to ensure sectional harmony. In 1854, Houston alienated Democrats in Texas and the South even further by opposing the Kansas-Nebraska Bill because it allowed the status of slavery to be determined by popular sovereignty, a concept he saw as potentially destabilizing to the nation...As a lame-duck senator, Houston ran for governor of Texas in 1857. He was defeated in a rigorous campaign by the state Democratic party's official nominee, Hardin R. Runnels...Houston ran a second time for governor in 1859. Because of his name recognition, a temporary lull in the sectional conflict, and other factors, he defeated the incumbent, Runnels...When Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States, the clamor of discontent in Texas prompted Houston to call a special session of the state legislature. Adamantly opposed to secession, Houston warned Texans that civil war would result in a Northern victory and destruction of the South...when he refused to take the oath of loyalty to the newly formed Confederate States of America, the Texas convention removed him from office on March 16 and replaced him with Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark two days later.\\\"\\n\\nDid you see when things changed? Did you see the big event? The racist Democratic party kicked Houston out. Houston was in the American Party not the Republican Party, but Texas didn't have a Republican Party at that time. There were a number of what we would consider conservative or classically liberal parties around the US at that time including the American, Union, Republican and Whig Parties. Houston was anti-slavery and pro-union just like Lincoln. Houston didn't want Texas engaged in the Civil War on the part of the confederacy. Lincoln, the Unionist, was a Republican! That's right! The Republicans were the pro-union, anti-slavery party. Don't believe people on the lie that the times have changed either. President Lyndon Johnson was a Texas Democrat as late as the 1960s who saw fit to honor the very same <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Clark_(governor)\\\">Texas Democrat Governor Edward Clark</a> that kicked Sam Houston out by awarding his grandson, also named <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Clark_(diplomat)\\\">Edward Clark</a>, an ambassadorship in 1965 to Australia. On an interesting side-note, the younger Ed Clark has been accused of playing a hand in the assassination of JFK.\\n\\nThe Democratic Party took over Texas in 1859 and, although the state is now red, things haven't been pretty around here or the larger US since.\\n\\nThe Democratic Party is the racist party of America. They even founded the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Overview.3B_Three_Klans\\\">Ku Klux Klan</a>! That's right, the Klan was first founded in 1865 by Democrats. Their terrorist klansman attacked many white Republican abolition supporters, just as it did black freedmen. \\\"The Prescript,\\\" the first official document of KKK beliefs, was written by Confederate Army Veteran and Democratic Congressman <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gordon_(Civil_War_General)\\\">George Gordon</a>. The Klan acted as the terrorist wing of the Democratic party for years, intimidating the South into a racism it otherwise wouldn't have had. See the two videos below for an overview of a comparison of the Democratic Party vs the Republican party on issues of race:\\n\\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mdV9THNKSk&amp;w=420&amp;h=315]\\n\\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfEW4MFoU5o&amp;w=420&amp;h=315]\\n\\nAccording to the videos, Democrats:\\n-Opposed black rights in their party platform by opposing the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford\\\">Dred Scott decision</a>\\n-Founded the KKK\\n-Fought against the 13th-15th amendments\\n-Instituted Jim Crow Laws\\n-Fought against the civil rights act\\n-Continue to promote cultural racism and division in the modern day not only around whites and blacks but also Hispanics and others.\\n-<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd#Ku_Klux_Klan\\\">Bob Byrd</a> served as a Democratic Senator for many years, until he died in 2010. He had been not only a member, but a leader in the KKK.\\n-Are mutually cooperating with the media in their perpetuation of racism\\n\\nRather than saying the cause is the Democratic Party, however, we need to realize that the Democratic Party is made up of people. These people are ideologically unified and are therefore strongly motivated to band together and form a political party. While it may be true in our modern time that being raised in a Democratic culture leads to racism, originally, when there was no such party, that was not the case. Ideology comes first. It is the ideology that we should be tracing as the root evil, rather than the political party per se, although the two are exceptionally correlated.\\n\\nThe reason I bring up the ideology point is multifaceted:\\n1) We know that liberals constitute the democratic party and therefore have evidence that (modern, not classical) liberalism is the real problem\\n2) We know that there are some ideological liberals which have infected the Republican party and pretend to be conservative. They are called neoconservatives and arguably include Marco Rubio, the Bush family, Boehner, McCain and others.\\n3) Ideology pervades more than politics and may be identified as an enemy in business, academic thinking, religion, personal behavior, and other locations, structures or manifestations.\\n4) In case we defeat the Democratic Party entirely, don't pretend that the fight is over.\\n\\nAs I come near closing this article I would mention that liberals and the Democratic party are making their strongest racist actions yet in abortion. <a href=\\\"http://40yearstoomany.com/abortions-impact-on-minorities/\\\">More than 55% of abortions are on minorities</a>. According to the article just linked:\\n\\n\\\"<i>In the history of America, immigrants, minorities and the poor have often been treated as social outcasts and blamed for all sorts of social ills. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, argued that “all our problems are the result of overbreeding among the working class.”</i>\\n\\nToday Planned Parenthood, America’s leading abortion promoter and provider, identifies its “core clients” as “young women, ‘low-income women, and women of color.\\\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, remember this Juneteenth that the real racists are the Democrats, the liberals, and, more than any others, the abortionists...Who are usually also liberal democrats.",

    "title": "New Atheism Is Contradictory, Ignorant of Christianity",
    "date": "2013-07-01",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<a href=\\\"http://news.yahoo.com/atheists-unveil-fla-monument-near-ten-commandments-195201537.html\\\">This recent article</a> detailed the fact that an atheist monument has recently been erected in <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Florida\\\" href=\\\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.1,-81.6&amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;q=28.1,-81.6 (Florida)&amp;t=h\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"geolocation\\\">Florida</a>, and it may be the first atheist monument allowed on government property in the US.\\n\\nI'm glad they erected the monument. My hope is that it represents a paradigm shift in the community where, rather than seeking to silence <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Christianity\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Christianity</a>, they have decided to embrace free speech and speak on their own beliefs and lack thereof. Furthermore the monument will provide an excellent preaching ground if many atheists are attracted to it.\\n\\nThere are obviously concerning points to be made here as well. First of all, the erection of monuments is an extremely religious practice and runs contrary to the idea that atheism, New Atheism in particular, is not a religious movement. The organization of atheists into groups responsible for the monument and various ongoing legal battles is also religious. Finally, the idea that atheism is a lack of belief is also contradicted by the unity of belief presented in the monument itself. The monument did not have a lack of text. Atheists now have their beliefs written in stone and it stands as an excellent monument to their own contradiction.\\n\\nAnother issue highlighted in the article is the fact that these atheists who claim they are opposed to Christianity are in fact, as far as shown inside the article anyway, opposed only to poor interpretations of Christianity. The atheist monument was erected as a counterpoint to a nearby monument containing the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Ten Commandments\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Ten Commandments</a>.One atheist said that the Ten Commandments, \\\"...in context, says atheists should be killed.\\\" This is not Christianity at all! The <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Old Testament\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Old Testament</a> cannot be interpreted on its own and be called anything except Judaism.\\n\\nA clarifying question would be, \\\"Which context are you putting it in, the intended Christian context or not?\\\" If the answer is that the atheist is assuming the most offensive possible interpretation then not only does that show his own ignorance, it also places him on a team with the Christian! The Christian would agree that Judaism is not a preferable belief system. The atheist's statement about context is simply false if he is referring to the intended Christian context. The New Testament tells us <a href=\\\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%205:9-13&amp;version=NIV\\\">not to police the actions of unbelievers</a>, and inside the church we should <a href=\\\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%205:17-22&amp;version=NIV\\\">not even hate each other let alone kill each other</a>.\\n\\nNew Atheism is a recent pop-culture atheism movement led by Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris and Dennett who have been called the \\\"<a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ-xK_PEDgc\\\">four horsemen of new atheism</a>,\\\" as well as other less notable figures such as the Amazing Atheist. <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13AjsFRR9Mk\\\">The movement</a> has taken place both online and in the popular media with online sources including in particular <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"YouTube\\\" href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"homepage\\\">YouTube</a>, social media and online video games. As I conclude I will leave you with a video from One Minute Apologist where <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"William Lane Craig\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">William Lane Craig</a> tries to sum up the origins of the New Atheism movement with which he has been thoroughly involved, as an adversary, for many years:\\n\\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3lWXFoBrzM&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]\\n<h6 class=\\\"zemanta-related-title\\\" style=\\\"font-size:1em;\\\">Related articles</h6>\\n<ul class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul\\\">\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.msatheists.org/2013/06/first-public-monument-to-atheism.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">First Public Monument to Atheism Unveiled Today</a> (msatheists.org)</li>\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/29/atheists-unveil-monument-in-florida-and-promise-to-build-50-more/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Atheists unveil monument in Florida and promise to build 50 more</a> (rawstory.com)</li>\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://myshieldmyrefuge.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/atheists-unveil-florida-monument-near-ten-commandments/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Atheists unveil Florida monument near Ten Commandments</a> (myshieldmyrefuge.wordpress.com)</li>\\n</ul>",

innovation of our age, something new appears.  Like the internet that came before, an obscure open-source computer protocol is poised to create and destroy whole industries and has already become a source of agita for government types the world over.\\n\\nWhile much has been said and written about the nascent <em>crypto-currency</em>'s underlying technology and recent volatility, one nagging

it should, given Bitcoin's potential to overwrite the matrix of the world's ailing currency system even faster than the internet went mainstream.  This will be among the topics of discussion this October at an unusual gathering of libertarians, economists, and computer scientists in Atlanta for the first ever <a href=\\\"http://www.cryptocurrencycon.com/\\\">Crypto-Currency Conference</a>.\\n\\nFor the uninitiated, it might be helpful to think of Bitcoin as a numbered Swiss bank account living on your smartphone.  By swiping your phone's camera over a special barcode, retail and online purchases can be made with virtually no transaction fees.  It's the ultimate bank debit card, except there's no card -- or bank for that matter.\\n\\nOne last thing: there aren't any dollars, either.\\n\\nInstead, your Bitcoin (BTC) balance is displayed alongside its equivalent in the currency of your choice.  So, if you're based in the States, you would set your smartphone to display the funds as USD.  Just like othercurrencies, BTC floats against the dollar, but unlike the so-called <em>fiat currencies</em> of the world, it is finite and can't be inflated by a central bank -- which is to say that BTC can't be destroyed by a central bank.  Bitcoin are readily convertible to even the most unpronounceable of world currencies, making the currency a sort of financial Rosetta Stone.\\n\\nThis very day, some 50 million BTC transactions will be validated by the largest distributed computing infrastructure ever assembled, and no company or government controls it -- or <em>can</em> control it.  The system went online in January of 2009 and is now growing at a rate resembling the internet's growth curve of the 1990s.\\n\\nThough often referred to as a virtual currency because Bitcoin live in the ether, they are as real as the funds we access every time we reach for our debit cards.  But, as no company or government backs the system, the asset is more like gold and silver in that its value is set by a worldwide market of buyers and sellers.  The fact that there is no corresponding physical commodity establishing its value means that it derives its worth solely on the market's assessment of its usefulness as a store of value, a <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Currency\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">means of exchange</a>, a universally fungible and astonishingly transportable currency.  The peer-to-peer nature of the Bitcoin protocol obviates the need to have any repositories -- read: banks -- eliminating the possibility that funds could ever be seized or frozen.\\n\\nThe value of Bitcoin's unique attributes became apparent recently, when Cyprus began raiding bank accounts and imposing capital controls where withdrawals were capped, and then restricted from leaving the country.  The reaction was a wholesale evacuation out of euros into every kind of alternative, with many disappearing into the ether as Bitcoin, sending the currency's value soaring.  Interestingly, this occurred throughout Europe's banking trouble spots, but not in Cyprus, since the currency was almost completely unknown there and the Cypriots were caught a day late and a euro short.\\n\\nConfronted with the need to \\\"smuggle\\\" one's own money out of a country, a Bitcoin fortune can be moved by simply toting an iPhone.  This realization will not be lost on those living in other troubled regions, so it is reasonable to think that much more wealth will disappear into the ether, setting the foundation for the Bitcoin Economy, which knows no borders.\\n\\n<strong>Slow-Motion Theft</strong>\\n\\nOminously, and for perhaps the first time in history, the central banks of America, Japan, Europe, and the U.K. are acting in concert as they print aggressively, creating an illusion of stability -- one currency relative to the other -- while consumers wonder where their purchasing power has gone.  This, we are told, is how moribund economies are resuscitated.\\n\\n[caption id=\\\"\\\" align=\\\"alignright\\\" width=\\\"300\\\"]<a

href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">central bankers</a> may have set themselves up for a rude shock.  How could they possibly have imagined something so arcane as a crypto-currency acting as an opt-out vehicle for those who would otherwise have remained trapped within their system?\\n\\nTo be sure, other alternatives like gold and silver exist, but Bitcoin seem to have an advantage since they can move as freely as e-mail.  Commodity-based currencies require a depository and the issuance of chits, either physical or virtual, which act as money substitutes when used in transactions.  Such systems impose a burden on the currency and the taking of counter-party risk, the loss of privacy, and the certainty of being under one government thumb or another.  They lead inevitably to rackets like fractional reserve banking, credit expansion, and inflation.\\n\\nSince the monetary base of the Bitcoin system is finite, the value of individual Bitcoin are likely to increase as wealth leaves one mortally wounded <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Fiat money\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">fiat currency</a> after another.  Bitcoin's emergence as an appreciating safe haven may well drive its status not as the world's new reserve currency, but as the default one.\\n\\nIn the ether is a kind of freedom that none of us could have imagined.  Beyond simply opting out of depreciating government currencies, each with its attendant ties to taxation and regulation, Bitcoin provides a means of escape into a free and largely anonymous parallel economy.\\n\\nAs real wealth migrates into the ether, so too will the prospect of earning there.  The resulting capital formation will spawn unimaginable new industries with stocks, debentures, and payrolls, all denominated in BTC and held anonymously.\\n\\nThe new currency will be impossible for any government on earth to regulate, though they can be counted upon to try.  Reluctant to legitimize the notion of a crypto-currency, the U.S. government has been slow to announce a regulatory regime, even while they have begun targeting so-called <em>money transmitters</em>, or <em>exchanges</em> which convert large-scale funds from USD to BTC.  But transactions of smaller amounts are routinely done in person at spontaneous meet-ups of regular folk wanting to trade in and out of USD and BTC.  In the end, the bureaucrats would have a better chance at regulating the next version of \\\"World of Warcraft.\\\"\\n\\nThe world's political class would do well to make a virtue out of necessity and leave the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Bitcoin\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Bitcoin economy</a> alone.  By allowing it to flourish, citizens will have somewhere to run should, or when, state currencies hyper-inflate.  A ready alternative like Bitcoin could provide for a much needed soft landing.\\n\\n<strong><em>Robert Berry writes about economic and constitutional matters and

I just don’t think it is going to happen straight away.”\\n\\nUnlike the U.S., in the U.K., the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Church of England\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Church of England</a> is affiliated with the government. But with the advance of the homosexual-rights movement under President Obama’s leadership, American churches already are being advised to prepare for similar pressure.\\n\\nSeveral major organizations are urging churches immediately to build in legal protections against anyone who might demand that they perform same-sex weddings.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.csbc.com/article370250.htm?title=1&amp;body=1\\\">An advisory from the California Southern Baptist Convention,</a> for example, warns: “It is important that pastors take steps to protect the theological integrity of the church as it relates to marriage ceremonies, counseling, and other related activities, such as, use of church facilities, employees, and membership.”\\n\\nIt quotes Kevin Snider, chief counsel of the Pacific Justice Institute.\\n\\n“Snider encourages churches to ‘review, edit and implement’ the model marriage policy ‘immediately.’ He noted the policy does not have to be included in the church bylaws but suggests that it be adopted by an appropriate church body such as the church board, church council or the church membership.”\\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/48/MarriagePoliciesPJIJuly2013.pdf\\\">The policy</a> recommended by PJI notes that marriage “is a union ordained by God.”\\n\\n“It was first instituted by God in the early chapters of Genesis, codified in the Levitical law, the Old Testament prophets compared it to a relationship between God and his people, examples of it are in the historical narratives, and, the wisdom literature discusses the unique unity of this relationship. Jesus explained the original intention and core elements of marriage, and several <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"New Testament\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">New Testament Epistles</a> give explicit instructions on this union,” the policy proposal says.\\n\\n“Marriage is a typology of Christ and the Church. As such, the Church views marriage as a profound spiritual institution established by God.”\\n\\nThe policy includes requirements that only ordained clergy officiate and that minister would be subject to dismissal and loss of ordination “for officiating a <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Same-sex marriage\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">same gender marriage</a> ceremony.”\\n\\nIt requires that anyone “wishing to have a ceremony performed by a member of the clergy employed by the church, or to use the church facilities, shall affirm their agreement with the Articles of Faith and shall conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent.”\\n\\nThe policy also requires a mandatory counseling period with clergy or counselors before any wedding and requires anyone officiating at a wedding on church property to follow its articles of faith.\\n\\nThe California Baptists note a church may also choose to state in its section regarding doctrine “that every member of the church is in agreement with the provisions of the doctrinal section in both faith and practice.”\\n\\n“The church also can state that its staff will not participate in same-sex unions and its property will not be used to promote such purposes.”\\n\\nThe U.K. case, however, is different because of the link between church and government.\\n\\nAs the officially recognized church, the Church of England is obligated to marry anyone in the local parish. Government attorneys have said that under the European Court of Human Rights, the church exemption in the new law is “eminently challengeable.”\\n\\nPrior to passage of the law, the prime minister was sent a legal opinion by Lord George Carey, former archbishop of Canterbury, warning that the parliament’s plan to redefine marriage would trigger legal problems and end the 500-year link between church and state, the Christian Institute said.\\n\\nChurch of England officials had called the government’s proposal to adopt same-sex unions was “divisive.”\\n\\nThey said redefining marriage “would alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions throughout history.”\\n\\nSource: <a href=\\\"http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/gays-to-sue-church-to-perform-marriage-ceremonies/\\\">http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/gays-to-sue-church-to-perform-marriage-ceremonies/</a>\\n<h6 class=\\\"zemanta-related-title\\\" style=\\\"font-size:1em;\\\">Related articles</h6>\\n<ul class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul\\\">\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.christian.org.uk/news/gay-couple-to-sue-church-over-gay-marriage-opt-out/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Gay couple to sue church over gay marriage opt-out</a> (christian.org.uk)</li>\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://atwistedcrownofthorns.com/2013/08/01/gay-couple-to-sue-church-for-not-peforming-same-sex-marriage/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Gay couple to sue Church for not peforming same sex marriage.</a> (atwistedcrownofthorns.com)</li>\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/gay-couple-wants-to-force-church-to-host-gay-weddings.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Gay Couple Wants to Force Church to Host Gay Weddings</a> (radio.foxnews.com)</li>\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://endtimeheadlines.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/days-of-lot-gay-couple-to-sue-church-over-gay-marriage-opt-out/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">DAYS OF LOT: Gay couple to sue church over gay marriage opt-out</a> (endtimeheadlines.wordpress.com)</li>\\n</ul>",

    "title": "J. Warner Wallace: Unbelievable? Is There Enough Evidence Beyond the Gospels to Make Their Testimony Reliable?",
    "date": "2013-08-22",

    "content": "<em><a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/2013/unbelievable-is-there-enough-evidence-beyond-the-gospels-to-make-their-testimony-reliable/\\\">Source</a> - J. Warner Wallace - coldcasechristianity.com - 8/22/13</em>\\n\\n<strong>[From John: J. Warner Wallace is a cold case detective and Christian apologetic. He is well known for his evidence-based approach, treating the Bible just like a crime to solve. In this post he gives corroborative evidence for the validity of the Bible and explains what that means and why it matters. He also has a great book out, Cold Case Christianity, one of the best apologetic books out there. Available as an e-book on Amazon as well as other places.]</strong>\\n\\nDuring my recent interview on <a href=\\\"http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx\\\">Unbelievable? with Justin Brierley</a> (airing Saturday, August 24<sup>th</sup>2013), a caller asked about corroboration and wanted to know if there was enough evidence beyond the Gospels to verify the reliability of their testimony. I began by helping him understand the nature of evidential corroboration and the limited information typically offered by such evidence. Every piece of corroborative evidence typically addresses (and verifies) only a “touchpoint”, a small aspect of the testimony from which we infer the “reasonability” of the larger account. <a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/2013/we-can-corroborate-the-gospels-without-verifying-every-detail/\\\">Corroborative evidence is always limited</a>; it only addresses a small aspect of the event under consideration. Even with these limits, however, the Gospels are still well corroborated. I’ve written a chapter about this in my book, <a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/cold-case-christianity-by-j-warner-wallace/\\\"><i>Cold-Case Christianity</i></a>, but here is a brief summary of the evidence “beyond the Gospels”:\\n\\n<b>Ancient “Reluctant Admissions”</b>\\nNon-Christian authors and historians from antiquity mentioned Jesus or His followers repeatedly, even as they denied His Deity or the claims of His supporters. While these <a href=\\\"http://pleaseconvinceme.com/2012/is-there-any-evidence-for-jesus-outside-the-bible/\\\">ancient sources were hostile to the claims of the New Testament</a>, they reluctantly confirmed key elements of the Gospel narrative.\\n\\n<b>Josephus (37-101AD)</b>\\nEven when examining the a modest, redacted version of Josephus’ ancient account, it’s clear that this Jewish historian reluctantly affirmed the following: <i>Jesus lived in Palestine, was a wise man and a teacher, worked amazing deeds, was accused by the Jews, crucified under Pilate and had followers called Christians</i>.\\n\\n<b>Thallus (52AD)</b>\\nWhile Thallus appeared to deny the supernatural aspect of the gospel narratives, he did reluctantly repeat and affirm the following: <i>Jesus lived, was crucified, and there was an earthquake and darkness at the point of his crucifixion</i>.\\n\\n<b>Tacitus (56-120AD)</b>\\nCornelius Tacitus (known for his analysis and examination of historical documents and among the most trusted of ancient historians) described Nero’s response to the great fire in Rome and reluctantly affirmed the following: <i>Jesus lived in Judea, was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and had followers who were persecuted for their faith in Christ</i>.\\n\\n<b>Mara Bar-Serapion (70AD)</b>\\nSometime after 70AD, this Syrian philosopher, writing to encourage his son, compared the life and persecution of Jesus with that of other philosophers who were persecuted and reluctantly affirmed the following: <i>Jesus was a wise and influential man who died for his beliefs, His followers adopted these beliefs and lived lives that reflected them</i>.\\n\\n<b>Phlegon (80-140AD)</b>\\nPhlegon wrote a chronicle of history around 140AD and reluctantly affirmed the following details about Jesus: <i>Jesus had the ability to accurately predict the future, was crucified under the reign of Tiberius Caesar and demonstrated his wounds after he was resurrected.</i>\\n\\n<b>Archaeological Discoveries</b>\\nMany volumes have been written about the archaeological support for the Old and New Testament, including this very brief list of archaeological corroborations:\\n\\n<b>Related to Quirinius\\n</b>Luke wrote that Joseph and Mary returned to Bethlehem because a Syrian governor named Quirinius was conducting a census (Luke 2:1–3). Archaeological discoveries in the nineteenth century revealed Quirinius (or someone with the same name) was also a proconsul of Syria and Cilicia from 11 BC to the death of Herod. Quirinius’s name has been discovered on a coin from this period of time, and on the base of a statue erected in Pisidian Antioch.\\n\\n<b>Related to Erastus</b>\\nIn Romans 16:23, Paul wrote, “Erastus, the city treasurer greets you.” A piece of pavement was discovered in Corinth in 1929 confirming his existence.\\n\\n<b>Related to Lysanias\\n</b>Luke described a tetrarch named Lysanias and wrote that this man reigned over Abilene when John the Baptist began his ministry (Luke 3:1). Two inscriptions have been discovered that mention Lysanias by name. One of these, dated from AD 14–37, identifies Lysanias as the tetrarch in Abila near Damascus.\\n\\n<b>Related to Iconium</b>\\nIn Acts 13:51, Luke described this city in Phyrigia. Some ancient writers (like Cicero) wrote that Iconium was located in Lycaonia, rather than Phyrigia, but a monument was discovered in 1910 that confirmed Iconium as a city in Phyrigia.\\n\\n<b>Related to the Pool of Bethesda\\n</b>John wrote about the existence of a pool of Bethesda (John 5:1–9) and said that it was located in the region of Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, surrounded by five porticos. In 1888, archaeologists began excavating the area near St. Anne’s Church in Jerusalem and discovered the remains of the pool, complete with steps leading down from one side and five shallow porticos on another side.\\n\\n<b>Related to Politarchs</b>\\nFor many centuries, Luke was the only ancient writer to use the word Politarch to describe “rulers of the city.” Skeptics doubted that it was a legitimate Greek term until nineteen inscriptions were discovered. Five of these were in reference to Thessalonica (the very city in which Luke was claiming to have heard the term).\\n\\n<b>Related to the Pool of Siloam\\n</b>John wrote about the “Pool of Siloam” (John 9:1–12) and described it as a place of ceremonial cleansing. Archaeologists Ronny Reich and Eli Shukrun excavated the pool and dated it from 100 BC to AD 100 (based on the features of the pool and coins found in the plaster).\\n\\n<b>Related to Pontius Pilate\\n</b>For many years, the only corroboration we had for the existence of Pontius Pilate (the governor of Judea who authorized the crucifixion of Jesus) was a very brief citation by Tacitus. In 1961, however, a piece of limestone was discovered bearing an inscription with Pilate’s name. The inscription was discovered in Caesarea, a provincial capital during Pilate’s term (AD 26–36), and it describes a building dedication from Pilate to Tiberius Caesar.<b></b>\\n\\n<b>Related to the Custom of Crucifixion\\n</b>While thousands of condemned criminals and war prisoners were reportedly executed in this manner, not a single one of them had ever been discovered in any archaeological site. In 1968, Vassilios Tzaferis found the first remains of a crucifixion victim, Yohanan Ben Ha’galgol, buried in a proper Jewish “kôkhîmtype” tomb.\\n\\n<b>Related to Sergius Paulus</b>\\nIn Acts 13, Luke identified Sergius Paulus, a proconsul in Paphos. Skeptics doubted the existence of this man and claimed that any leader of this area would be a “propraetor” rather than a proconsul. But an inscription was discovered at Soli in Cyprus that acknowledged Paulus and identified him as a proconsul.\\n\\nWhile the corroborative evidence “beyond the gospels” is extensive (I’ve only touched upon a few of the highlights), there is also significant evidence from “within the gospels” to corroborate their content, including (1) Accurate “unintentional eyewitness support” between gospel authors, (2) Accurate referencing of regional 1<sup>st</sup> century proper names, (3) Governmental functions, and (4) Little-known geographic locations, and (5) The proper use of ancient language. I’ve written about these corroborative evidences extensively in <a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/cold-case-christianity-by-j-warner-wallace/\\\">Chapter 12</a>. As we evaluate the gospel accounts with the <a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/2013/unbelievable-does-josephus-account-of-john-the-baptist-invalidate-the-gospels/\\\">same template we apply to court witnesses to determine their reliability</a>, the New Testament narratives withstand our scrutiny and display the earmarks of trustworthy testimony. This means we can have confidence in them as reliable history, supported (as we might expect) by the reluctant testimony of ancient non-Christian authors and the archaeological record of the period.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/113142867185332937744\\\">J.

Usually this argument is discounted because religion is thought to have no place in academia. Of course as students of caeconomics we disagree, and therefore this argument becomes much more relevant.\\n\\nSpecifically we care about the Christian argument for minarchism. All other religious arguments we may properly address through the use of apologetics. Interpretations of <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Christianity\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Christianity</a> vary, and some are fine with pure anarchism. Those who oppose anarchism in favor of some amount of government are largely sustained by two arguments:\\n\\n1) The Bible says \\\"render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's,\\\" \\\"obey the law of the land\\\" and similar things implying that <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"God\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">God</a> has given authority to government. Because God gave government some degree of authority, government must or should exist.\\n\\n2) God's perfect government, the government of heaven in New Jerusalem, includes God as monarch. Because God's society is the ideal one and it involves a government, we either must or should have a government.\\n\\n[caption id=\\\"\\\" align=\\\"alignright\\\" width=\\\"300\\\"]<a href=\\\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:005_Tiberius.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"zemanta-img-inserted\\\" title=\\\"The tribute penny mentioned in the Bible is co...\\\" alt=\\\"The tribute penny mentioned in the Bible is co...\\\" src=\\\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/005_Tiberius.jpg/300px-005_Tiberius.jpg\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a> The tribute penny mentioned in the Bible is commonly believed to be a Roman denarius depicting Tiberius. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)[/caption]\\n\\nWe can easily get rid of the idea that we must have government based on the fact that <a title=\\\"Can an Anarchic Nation Exist?\\\" href=\\\"http://caeconomics.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/can-an-anarchic-nation-exist/\\\">some societies already exist as anarchies</a>. The question of should is a bit more difficult. I do agree that God's perfect government should exist, but I don't agree that such a government is possible until after the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Second Coming\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">return of Christ</a>. So while it is true that God's perfect government is like a <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Benevolent dictatorship\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">benevolent dictatorship</a>, given that <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Christ\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Christ</a> hasn't returned yet to take his place as governor, the question becomes whether or not in his temporary absence a benevolent dictatorship is still the best choice.\\n\\nI would argue no. I would say a benevolent dictatorship is, in fact, not a choice at all for regular human beings. Regular morally fallible humans, I think, are not capable of maintaining a benevolent dictatorship for very much time at all. So what kind of government should we use? I say \\\"test all things, hold on to the good\\\" and \\\"you will know them by their fruit.\\\" In other words, in practice, put the government models on a market and let the government types compete. Then choose the best performer.\\n\\nThat free market of governance is the same as anarchy in my book.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that \\\"<a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Render unto Caesar...\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Render_unto_Caesar...\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Render unto Caesar</a>\\\" is not violated if there is no Caesar! We are still giving him what is his - nothing. I think this is actually related to the point <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Jesus\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Jesus</a> was making. It may seem like Caesar ran the world back then, but Jesus knew that one day he would be nothing and God would take his rightful place as ruler. Will Caesar be receiving taxes even while we live in the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"New Jerusalem\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jerusalem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">New Jerusalem</a>? I don't think so. Clearly, therefore, this was a temporary commandment on what we ought to do while Caesar or other governments were around, not a recommendation or command that Caesar or other governments should be around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think that God's government will and should exist, but that is neither possible nor practical until after the return of Christ. I also find strong backing for the idea of comparative government in the Bible. There is one other religious argument for minarchism based on the idea of the <a class=\\\"zem_slink\\\" title=\\\"Man of Sin\\\" href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Sin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"wikipedia\\\">Man of Lawlessness</a> or the so-called Antichrist, but I will have to go over that one separately as it is kind of complicated. For now I will just say that anarchy does not necessarily imply lawlessness and, furthermore, preventing anarchy will not prevent the Man of Lawlessness.\\n<h6 class=\\\"zemanta-related-title\\\" style=\\\"font-size:1em;\\\">Related articles</h6>\\n<ul class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul\\\">\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.independentsentinel.com/obamas-benevolent-dictatorship-is-fundamentally-transforming-the-usa/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Obama's Benevolent Dictatorship Is Fundamentally Transforming the USA</a> (independentsentinel.com)</li>\\n</ul>",

    "content": "<em><a href=\\\"http://bitcoinmagazine.com/6939/seans-outpost-announces-satoshi-forest/\\\">Source</a> - Bitcoin Magazine - Vitalik Buterin - 9/9/13</em>\\n\\n<strong>[From John: This article is about a bitcoin-based charity called Sean's Outpost. The organization works with the homeless in Florida and is doing some really positive things. The article serves as many as three purposes: First, the actions of Sean's Outpost serve as a good example of what I would consider as one kind of morally positive action. Second, the article does a great job of describing the context in a way that we can deduce some of the specific economic effects of that moral action. For example, one homeless man the organization helped turned out to be a Marine veteran and master carpenter. After being helped, the man contributed to construction plans for Sean's Outpost and later obtained full time employment. Lastly, the article is just an overall positive story that I hope will brighten your day!]</strong>\\n\\nOver the past five months, Sean’s Outpost has come to be perhaps the most well-known charity in the Bitcoin community. Sean’s Outpost, a homeless shelter in Pensacola, Florida run by Jason King, first started accepting Bitcoin in March 2013, carrying a simple message: “When we break down cost, it runs about $1.25 to make a bagged lunch and get it delivered to a homeless person. 40 meals = $50. $50 is K1 BTC. Here is your chance to make a guaranteed, phenomenal return on your investment. Donating 1 bitcoin right now will put food in the tummies of 40 homeless people.” Four days later, Sean’s Outpost had raised over over $600, and over the months that followed Sean’s Outpost and the Bitcoin community developed a symbiosis closer than either had thought would happen. King has become a <a href=\\\"http://reddit.com/user/SeansOutpost\\\">regular presence</a> on the Bitcoin Reddit community, participated as a speaker in the 2013 San Jose Bitcoin conference, and even ran as an candidate to become an industry member of the Bitcoin Foundation. Five months later, Sean’s Outpost has collected over $30,000 in Bitcoin funds. Now, Sean’s Outpost is going to be expanding much further than anyone imagined.\\n\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/satforest.png\\\" />\\n\\nEnter Satoshi Forest. The location at 1999 Massachusetts Ave, Pensacola, FL encompasses nine acres of wooded land that will now become, as Jason King describes it, “a homeless sanctuary, a place where the downtrodden can find respite from the ‘crime’ of being simply being poor.” The property cost $89,000 to purchase, which, King writes, “for acreage within the developed part of greater Pensacola, is dirt cheap.” The mortgage on the property, valued at $600 per month, will be paid entirely in Bitcoin – not, King clarifies, by converting the BTC donations that they receive into USD, but sending bitcoins directly to the mortgage holder as payment. The mortgage holder is in fact a real-estate company with properties in Florida, Alabama, Colorado and California and, thanks to the Sean’s Outpost crew’s efforts, the company is now accepting Bitcoin for its entire portfolio.\\n\\nKing’s description of homelessness as a “crime” is no exaggeration; recently, the Pensacola City Council passed a “camping ban” ordinance <a href=\\\"http://inweekly.net/wordpress/?p=15112\\\">that prohibited</a>, among other things, sleeping outside or in a temporary shelter, washing, shaving, washing one’s clothing or preparing food in public, public urination and “aggressive solicitation, begging or panhandling”. “I have been told that if I bring someone freezing [who is sleeping outside] a blanket, I will be aiding and abetting in a crime,” King wrote <a href=\\\"http://bitcoinmagazine.com/6499/an-interview-with-jason-king-from-seans-outpost/\\\">in a recent interview</a>. In fact, King was forced to keep Satoshi Forest secret until now simply because he was afraid that, even though everything he is doing is entirely legal under the “no camping” ordinance and Pensacola zoning law, “someone could come in and stop us at any moment”. Fortunately, no one did. “It happened,” King writes, “it’s done. Satoshi Forest is real. It’s not shipping in two weeks. You can go to 1999 Massachusetts Ave. in Pensacola and put your hands on it. And we just got our filed deed back from the county, so it is most definitely ours. And by ours, I mean the collective goodwill of the Crypto Currency community.”\\n\\nThe Sean’s Outpost crew, including Jason King himself as well as his wife Leslie, Mike Kimberl and Adam Richard, intends to use Satoshi Forest as the base for a number of projects. The first, and most obvious, are the “BitHouses”. As the name suggests, the BitHouses are intended to serve as proper homes for the homeless, and will be designed as “recreational vehicles” (ie. houses on wheels) and not static houses or buildings in part to reduce the risk that zoning rules and inspection requirements will be used against them, and in part so that people can leave with them “if they get on their feet and want to move to their own space.” One of these homes will be able to house two people – “up to four if you are ‘really familiar’ with that person,” and will each cost about 65 BTC to produce. The houses will also be sold to the public One Laptop Per Child-style: you pay for two, one goes to the homeless and one for yourself. Although construction is starting in the fall, weather should not be a problem; “One of our first ‘projects’ in the forest is the construction of a large pole barn that we will be able to accomplish all of the construction underneath.”\\n\\nBut Satoshi Forest will not stop there. Once housing construction is well underway, they also intend to add a large kitchen for preparing food, and then begin organic farming operations which he later intends to expand to aquaculture. Ultimately, King writes, “we envision Satoshi Forest morphing into an organic farm/makerspace with a Summer Camp feel. Apart from the obvious of growing food to further our operations, learning how to farm is an invaluable skill and one that is slowly being taken away by the corporate food monopolies. There’s something damn near magical about showing someone how to plant and grow their own food. There’s not much more pride to be had then eating food you grew. Construction/Makerspace is the same, it’s showing someone that they have abilities to turn a stack of raw materials into something of value.” The “summer camp” aspect is also important; “everyone at summercamp lives in conditions very similar to being homeless,” King explains, “but no one is looked upon like being a worthless piece of garbage.”\\n\\nAnd ultimately that is what Sean’s Outpost and Satoshi Forest are all about: providing food for the homeless and giving them blankets to keep warm, but also being a place where “people who have no hope can find a little, learn a skill, find people who look at them as fellow humans.” At one point, King found a man under a local bridge who had been put on the streets in little more than boxer shorts after being admitted to an emergency room following a cardiac attack. “He was really depressed,” King recalls, “[he] felt like the whole world was against him.” As it turned out, the man was a decorated Marine veteran and a master carpenter, and once Sean’s Outpost took him in he even helped provide ideas for the housing construction projects. Over time, he started getting better, worked odd jobs to save up money to buy a van, and “as of last week he actually has a full-time job and an apartment.”\\n\\nSean’s Outpost has become a testament to both Bitcoin and the ideals that many in the Bitcoin community hold dear. One and a half years ago, Jon Matonis wrote an article entitled “<a href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/03/19/could-bitcoin-become-the-currency-of-system-d/\\\">Could Bitcoin Become the Currency of System D?</a>“, where System D refers to the underground and informal economy that makes up one sixth of the world’s GDP. The “D” stands for “débrouillardise”, a French word perhaps best translated as “<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver\\\">MacGyverism</a>” – using the natural human capacity for creativity and ingenuity to take maximal advantage of limited resources to solve complex and meaningful problems. We can see this in the real world everywhere; people in France and Spain laying down an array of sunglasses on a towel and selling them for a few dollars each every day, vendors selling food on the street, and much of the informal person-to-person trade that happens over the internet.\\n\\nMuch of this trade is never registered in censuses or tax forms, and operating costs and revenues are very low, and yet the value generated by this so-called “shadow economy” for its participants is all too real. In fact, this economy often acts as a crucial safety net to keep people alive in those places where formal economies and governments are simply not there. Sean’s Outpost, in many ways, is similar. Rather than being a project dreamed up by bureaucrats seeking to get people into “the system” as quickly as possible, and earn generous salaries along the way, Sean’s Outpost is a grassroots operation borne out of compassion and experience interacting with real people, and stretches every dollar (or rather, every bitcent) far more than most people can hope to achieve. In a time when many people simply don’t have the money to pay increasingly high mortgages and rent, the fact that Sean’s Outpost can produce a fully-functional home for two to four people for less than ten thousand dollars, and pay for a meal for $1.25, is hugely invaluable for the people it serves. The shelter is funded by donations from thousands of people around the world, North Americans and Europeans, rich and poor, individuals and <a href=\\\"https://www.smore.com/feux-sean-s-outpost\\\">corporations</a> alike; in this regard, it is one of the best examples of the entire Bitcoin community pooling its resources together.\\n\\nNow that Satoshi Forest has gotten through the initial hurdle of setting itself up, the harder work is about to begin. Building homes for dozens of people is no small task, and it will take many months to set up the housing and organic farming projects. Once it is complete, though, Satoshi Forest can be a model for many similar projects elsewhere. It does not even need to be specifically about the poor and homeless; many people voluntarily choose seemingly “lower class” lifestyles either because they want to work on projects that benefit the community but which are not monetarily well-rewarded, or simply because they prefer a more communitarian means of living; there are already a number of communities in Europe which are organized around precisely that model. A homeless shelter in Florida, specialized startup incubators and living spaces in Silicon Valley, a <a href=\\\"http://bitcoinmagazine.com/6487/bitcoin-in-berlin/\\\">city district in Berlin</a>, and meetup in hundreds of cities around the world all point to one conclusion: Bitcoin has become much more than just a currency.\\n\\n<strong>Source: </strong><a href=\\\"http://bitcoinmagazine.com/6939/seans-outpost-announces-satoshi-forest/\\\">http://bitcoinmagazine.com/6939/seans-outpost-announces-satoshi-forest/</a>",

Disruption. I've previously railed against the startup scene's fashionable \\\"disruptors\\\" <a href=\\\"http://www.zdnet.com/iphone-therefore-i-am-a-selfish-disruptor-7000015844/\\\">smashing the piñata of public services</a> to scoop up the shiniest, most profitable parts for themselves, and damn the consequences for everyone else. But today, I'm talking about disruption on a much longer timescale.\\n\\nIn his 1980 book <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave_(Toffler)\\\"><em>The Third Wave</em></a>, futurist Alvin Toffler described what he saw as the three great waves of change that have transformed human society.\\n\\nThe First Wave was the Neolithic Revolution, when settled agricultural societies replaced the hunter-gatherers.\\n\\nThe Second Wave began as the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe, which then spread across the planet. Second Wave societies were about the nuclear family, a factory-type education system, and the corporation.\\n\\n\\\"The Second Wave society is industrial and based on mass production, mass distribution, mass consumption, mass education, mass media, mass recreation, mass entertainment, and weapons of mass destruction. You combine those things with standardisation, centralisation, concentration, and synchronisation, and you wind up with a style of organisation we call bureaucracy,\\\" Toffler wrote.\\n\\nA key part of Toffler's theme was that the very nature of Second Wave transport and communications technologies defined the physical scale on which things were organised — had to be organised. Nation-states were the size they were because transnational railways \\\"extended the actual, as distinct from nominal, control of the national government. Washington could now move troops quickly all across the continent to enforce its authority\\\", and all that was organised via the telegraph and then the telephone.\\n\\nAnd only something the size of a nation-state could afford to build and run those things.\\n\\nNearly half a century ago, I witnessed part of that Second Wave break over and engulf the dairy industry of southern Australia.\\n\\nUntil then, dairy farms had usually been husband-and-wife operations, milking a few dozen head of dairy cattle morning and night using mechanical suction devices. Milk was stored in 20-gallon cans, collected by trucks daily, and delivered to a local milk factory.\\n\\nBut during the 1960s and 1970s, all manner of technology arrived more or less at once. The<a href=\\\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/18495/herringbone-milking-shed\\\">herringbone milking shed</a> and then the <a href=\\\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/18497/rotary-milking-shed\\\">rotary milking shed</a> made it possible for a farm worker to milk more cows. Rural roads were paved, and diesel trucks became bigger, faster and more reliable. Bulk handling equipment was introduced, with milk stored in refrigerated tanks until collected by tanker truck every two or three days. Milk factories became larger, and fewer in number. Factories paid less for milk, and farms needed to scale up to hundreds of cows to remain viable.\\n\\nHusband-and-wife dairy farms were disrupted out of existence.\\n\\nNearly half a century later, Toffler's Third Wave of the Post-Industrial Society is now rolling across rural Australia. It splashed upon Hogarth Range, 750km north of Sydney, and one of the newly evolved critters in the shallows is a premium beef supplier that's — dare I say it? — disrupting the meat industry.\\n\\nDavid and Peta Moloney and family had lived in Canberra for a year, and weren't impressed with the meat available in supermarkets. High prices, even though farmers were paid just AU$3 per kilogram for the meat, and low quality thanks to the time it took the meat to make its way through the supply chain.\\n\\n\\\"This is so wrong,\\\" David Moloney told ZDNet this morning. \\\"There's a whole lot of expenses in getting it to the supermarket, and refrigeration costs, and transport costs, wastage, and so forth.\\\" Peta Moloney came up with idea of eliminating all that, David said. \\\"I put together the business plan, and the website and all the technical side of it, and away we went.\\\"\\n\\nAnd thus, in 2004-05, <a href=\\\"http://www.honestbeef.com.au/\\\">Honest Beef</a> was born.\\n\\nThe concept is simple. Honest Beef sells directly to consumers, who order 20-kilogram \\\"beef packs\\\" and other standard packages. \\\"Six to seven of them is one animal, and when we get seven orders, we ring up the farmer and say, 'What weights have you got?' and he says, 'I've got one of those', and away it goes, off into the abattoir,\\\" Moloney said.\\n\\n\\\"The idea is that the animal's still running around the paddock when you make an order. We don't store beef at all. We have no refrigeration, we have no nothing,\\\" he said. \\\"We're cash-flow positive. We get paid before the animal's dead.\\\"\\n\\nWhen it's \\\"fully consigned\\\", as Honest Beef's <a href=\\\"http://www.honestbeef.com.au/order_cycle.php\\\">explanation</a> coyly puts it.\\n\\n\\\"We don't do PayPal, we don't do any of the credit cards. They charge too much, that eats into our profits, and we have to pass that on to the consumer. Direct payment and Bitcoin, they cost us nothing.\\\"\\n\\nYes, Bitcoin.\\n\\nHonest Beef started accepting the digital currency earlier this year. Is anyone using it? \\\"Plenty,\\\" Moloney said. \\\"The last two animals we sent off, we had [those] two pay by Bitcoin, and we've got a third waiting. We're probably getting 10 to almost 20 percent of our customers paying by Bitcoin now.\\\"\\n\\nNow, there's nothing particularly high-tech about Honest Beef. There's a website and Bitcoin, sure, but the rest is just telephones and trucks, emails and evisceration.\\n\\nThere's plenty of ways to scale it up. Farmers could register their cattle by location, weight, and condition. A mix-and-match algorithm could find the best way of assembling customer orders into a reverse-jigsaw puzzle that shared out the slaughter to minimise time and travel, and maximise profits. But why bother?\\n\\nHonest Beef illustrates what becomes possible when you start thinking of every business as something as a service. Or, as futurist Mark Pesce put it last year, when <a href=\\\"http://www.zdnet.com/au/the-future-of-business-is-lego-7000002486/\\\">every business is an API</a>.\\n\\nHonest Beef taps into commodified road and air logistics, and commodified digital banking and communications — all the generic stuff that's delivered globally at \\\"cloud scale\\\" because it's the same whether you're selling beef or tomatoes or shoes or children's toys or helicopters — and uses that infrastructure to deliver your personal share of a dead cow from a particular valley in northern New South Wales at a flat rate of AU$10.75 per kilogram. And the farmers keep 70 percent of that.\\n\\nI joke that I have \\\"my t-shirt maker in San Francisco\\\". But, realistically, we could all soon be like the Victorian aristocracy, every family having its own boutique provedores of gourmet foodstuffs as precisely specified as we like, and instead of a working class to deliver it, we've got robots and the cloud.\\n\\nWell, at least until the climate collapses and oil runs out and everything dies.\\n\\n<strong>Source: </strong><a href=\\\"http://www.zdnet.com/pay-heed-to-the-internets-third-wave-cows-of-disruption-7000020878/\\\">http://www.zdnet.com/pay-heed-to-the-internets-third-wave-cows-of-disruption-7000020878/</a>",

    "date": "2013-10-02",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article will cover some theology and apologetics on hell. This article is my summary of and commentary on a recent podcast series from J Warner Wallace.\\n\\nJ Warner Wallace recently released a podcast series called, \\\"Answering Common Objections to the Notion of Hell.\\\" <a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/2013/answering-common-objections-to-the-notion-of-hell-part-1-podcast/\\\">Part 1</a> was released a week ago and <a href=\\\"http://coldcasechristianity.com/2013/answering-common-objections-to-the-notion-of-hell-part-2-podcast/\\\">part 2</a> was released today. You can certainly listen to both podcasts, but there is quite a bit of fat in both and Wallace reviews the first podcast in the second podcast anyway. For that reason I will simply be summarizing and making notes on the second podcast, along with some of my personal points. Another good reason to watch the first podcast is if you are looking for specific scriptures to back up Wallace's various points.\\n\\n<strong>Notes on Part 2:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n\t<li>Why would a loving and merciful God send people to hell?</li>\\n\t<li>Because mercy, love and so on are meaningless if justice does not exist.</li>\\n\t<li>Because God would not be loving if he forced everyone to go do heaven. He would eliminate free will and the value and meaning that comes from choice.</li>\\n\t<li><strong>I would make the point that people equate eternal punishment with a punishment of infinite magnitude, however this is not necessarily the case. Anyone who has taken calculus understands that a function can occur over an infinite amount of time and produce only a finite product. For example, a <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Limit_(mathematics)&amp;oldid=572918520\\\">function may converge</a> to 0 without ever reaching 0, implying a function of infinite length which sometimes has a finite result.</strong></li>\\n\t<li>The punishment is set by the court. It doesn't matter whether the criminal thinks his punishment is fair.</li>\\n\t<li>A fair time scale of punishment does not reflect the time scale of the crime, it represents the degree of the offense. An accounting scheme can take years to execute while a brutal murder can take seconds.</li>\\n\t<li><strong>I would point out that many people think of sin as an offense of some finite magnitude which is being unfairly paired to an eternal punishment, but it may be the case that denial of God is an infinitely offensive crime.</strong></li>\\n\t<li>Wallace argues that the Bible says \\\"torment\\\" which is very different from \\\"torture.\\\" Torture implies physical pain while torment can indicate mental suffering. Wallace suggests that this mental suffering need not be inflicted by God. For example, it could be a result of regret. There is a huge difference between self-inflicted torment and active involuntary torture inflicted by someone else.</li>\\n\t<li><strong>I would point out that the term translated torment can also be translated punishment or destruction, leading to alternative translations of hell which involve even less suffering of any form. The bottom line, however, is that hell is negative to some indeterminate degree while heaven is positive to some degree. Regardless of those degrees it is still logical to pursue heaven.</strong></li>\\n\t<li>Why would a good God sent good people to hell?</li>\\n\t<li>Wallace says good isn't good enough. God only accepts perfection and no person is perfect besides Jesus. Therefore we have to ask for Jesus to take our place in judgement.</li>\\n\t<li><strong>I would argue that God doesn't send good people to hell. The problem, I would argue, is that people don't understand what is good. Because of a wrong idea of goodness some people think that good people are sent to hell.</strong></li>\\n\t<li>What about people who never hear the Gospel? How is it fair to judge them?</li>\\n\t<li>Wallace makes an argument based on a theological concept called \\\"middle knowledge.\\\" Some theologians claim that God has \\\"middle knowledge\\\" which means that not only is he omnipotent in the classical sense of knowing all truth and reality, but it also holds that God knows every possible or potential truth or reality. From this point of view God can still judge a person who may never have heard the gospel because he knows what that person would have done if they had heard the gospel.</li>\\n\t<li>In 2 Samuel a baby dies before understanding the gospel but goes to heaven.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h6 class=\\\"zemanta-related-title\\\" style=\\\"font-size:1em;\\\">Related articles</h6>\\n<ul class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul\\\">\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://str.typepad.com/weblog/2013/09/why-would-a-loving-god-create-a-place-like-hell.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Why Would A Loving God Create A Place Like Hell?</a> (str.typepad.com)</li>\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://str.typepad.com/weblog/2013/09/why-would-god-punish-finite-temporal-crimes-in-an-eternal-hell.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Why Would God Punish Finite, Temporal Crimes in an Eternal Hell?</a> (str.typepad.com)</li>\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://winteryknight.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/j-warner-wallace-six-reasons-why-you-should-believe-in-non-physical-minds/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">J.

    "title": "Easy Activism",
    "date": "2013-10-07",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article will cover 3 easy methods of activism. They can be used for political purposes, marketing, teaching and anything else that involves calling people to action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 3 methods are online activism, activism through guest calling radio shows and conversation tips for personal conversations, which is sometimes called \\\"canvassing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Online Activism</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.libertyclassroom.com/\\\">Tom Woods</a> is a great writer and teacher in the liberty movement. I totally take credit for David Friedman's appearance on the Tom Woods radio show. Screenshot from <a href=\\\"http://www.schiffradio.com/f/Tom-Woods\\\">comments section of The Tom Woods Show</a>:\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/HO1neHB.png\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/HO1neHB.png\\\" width=\\\"775\\\" height=\\\"206\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another case, he uploaded a radio episode to YouTube after I made the request. See the pictures below:\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-2128\\\" alt=\\\"woods1\\\" src=\\\"http://afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/woods1.jpg\\\" width=\\\"608\\\" height=\\\"379\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-2129\\\" alt=\\\"woods2\\\" src=\\\"http://afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/woods2.png\\\" width=\\\"661\\\" height=\\\"317\\\" /></p>\\r\\nA similar encounter occurred in a discussion with Bryan Fischer, the well known conservative talk show host of Focal Point With Bryan Fischer on AFR Talk:\\r\\n\\r\\n<img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2130\\\" alt=\\\"i3Qve1b\\\" src=\\\"http://afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/i3Qve1b.jpg\\\" width=\\\"577\\\" height=\\\"481\\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see I simply took a few seconds out of my day to make a call to action in the comments section of things they posted. Wording is key here. Do not be aggressive and find people to pitch to where it will result in a mutual benefit. Tom Woods promotes alternative education so I pitched him on Degreed. Bryan Fischer is a social conservative leader so I pitched him on ID.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis kind of online activism works with all manner of online media including forums, Reddit, blogs and so on, but I have noticed that it works particularly well with social media such as Facebook, and to a lesser degree, Twitter and YouTube.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Calling In To Radio Shows</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of Brian Fischer, calling into radio shows is a great method of activism as well. In all these kinds of activism be sure to look for key players to pitch to. If you convince a nobody that you have a great idea, you have just convinced nobody that you have a great idea. One problem with the radio method is that radio shows worth calling usually have far too many calls to squeeze in to the limited call taking time they allot. Use this method if you have a show you like and would listen to anyway. That creates a twofold benefit. First, if you like the material the show usually puts out it's more likely that the usual audience of the show will be somewhat like you and therefore may be sympathetic to your ideas. Secondly, if you call and don't get in you would have listened anyway so it's not such a waste of time.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Word of Mouth Activism and Canvassing</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst try to gauge the other person's sensitivity level by asking a general question related to your specific call to action. For example you might ask, \\\"What do you think about politics?\\\" If the answer is, \\\"I don't like to talk about that\\\" then take that into consideration and end the conversation quickly. You can still put in a related call to action as you wrap up. You might say, \\\"Oh ya I understand. It is a sensitive topic isn't it? I just bring it up because I was reading [insert book title here] yesterday and I thought it was pretty interesting. You should check it out you might be surprised.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the person is comfortable talking more directly then don't shy away from getting to your point, but try not to be aggressive either. \\\"So do you vote Democrat? Why...?\\\" Be open minded and actually listen to what they have to say. Make your call to action and get a definitive answer. Turning questions into a simple yes or no makes things simpler many times. You might ask, \\\"So will you meet me there at 6 pm next Monday?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, be sure never to set yourself up as the final authority or you will have your bluff called. Rather, try to talk someone else up and you will be recognized as someone who thinks highly of others rather than yourself. Additionally, talking other people up can be used as a tactic to motivate action. You might say, \\\"I know a good deal about this product but the guy I work with in the company actually invented our product. He's wicked smart and surprisingly nice. You should come meet him next week. He can probably tell you a few interesting details I missed.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI would also note that calling people to commit an easy action is usually more likely to be effective than calling them to conduct a difficult action. Getting an email is usually easier than making a sale and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope this helps!\\r\\n<h6 class=\\\"zemanta-related-title\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1em;\\\">Related articles</h6>\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul\\\">\\r\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/02/bryan-fischer-closing-wwii-memorial-proves-obamas-soul-has-a-heart-of-darkness/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Bryan Fischer: Closing WWII Memorial proves Obama's soul has a 'heart of darkness'</a> (rawstory.com)</li>\\r\\n\t<li class=\\\"zemanta-article-ul-li\\\"><a href=\\\"http://mashable.com/2013/09/25/clickivism/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Why 'Clicktivism' Isn't a Dirty Word</a> (mashable.com)</li>\\r\\n</ul>",

The findings met the conventional threshold of statistical significance, the professor said.\\n\\nKahan wrote that not only did the findings surprise him, they embarrassed him.\\n“I’ve got to confess, though, I found this result surprising. As I pushed the button to run the analysis on my computer, I fully expected I’d be shown a modest negative correlation between identifying with the Tea Party and science comprehension,” Kahan wrote.\\n“But then again, I don’t know a single person who identifies with the tea party,” he continued. “All my impressions come from watching cable tv — &amp; I don’t watch Fox News very often — and reading the ‘paper’ (New York Times daily, plus a variety of politics-focused Internet sites like Huffington Post and POLITICO). I’m a little embarrassed, but mainly, I’m just glad that I no longer hold this particular mistaken view.”\\n\\nWhile Kahan cautioned against thinking the results can be used to explain deep ideological fights over climate change and other politically relevant science, and he said the results wouldn’t change his negative views of the tea party, he did say he will no longer make assumptions about the level of knowledge on his opponents’ side.\\n\\n<strong>Source: </strong><a href=\\\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/tea-party-science-98488.html#.UmAq36vsXDk.twitter\\\">http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/tea-party-science-98488.html#.UmAq36vsXDk.twitter</a>",

    "title": "School Choice and Zero Tolerance",
    "date": "2013-11-07",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Tyack and Cuban state that the only constant in education is reform. They make this simple argument a little more sophisticated by noting that not all reforms are the same. Some are adopted quickly and others are adopted more slowly. Some last a short while and others last longer. Some reforms are themselves reformed and others are kept or discarded entirely. In this paper I will analyze three particular reforms from modern times and asses how those reforms will be maintained, be changed, or not be maintained as time goes on. In particular I will argue that modern policy instruments in education are here to stay, school choice is here to stay, and Zero Tolerance will change or fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some common characteristics between the flaws and strengths of these different education reform topics, but there are also some major differences. Education policy instruments impact different groups in the education system in different ways when compared to school choice for example. I am making a different argument for Zero Tolerance compared to the other two topics as well. For this reason we will not be comparing or contrasting the topics. The form of this paper will simply be to analyze each topic on its own merits one by one. In order to address the question of reform efficacy in context we need a working definition. Tyack and Cuban wrote a book called <i>Tinkering Toward Utopia</i> in which they analyze the history of reform in the United States. They offer the following definition: “When we speak of educational reforms, we mean planned efforts to change schools in order to correct perceived social and educational problems.” (Tyack and Cuban, 3)\\r\\n<p lang=\\\"en-US\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #000000;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: Code, Code, sans-serif;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-size: medium;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\\\"> With this definition in mind we will first look at a couple modern policy instruments. Jane Hannaway and Nicola Woodroffe published an article entitled “Policy Instruments in Education” where they talk about trends in policy reform for education. According to the article two major classes of policy instruments are now being used which were not being used before. (Hannaway and Woodroffe) This transition from older instruments to newer ones meets Tyack and Cuban’s definition of reform because the transition was planned in order to solve problems. According to the article, the first class of instruments, “are those that attempt to harness the advantages of market mechanisms, particularly the incentives stemming from competitive pressure, to direct school behavior.” The second class is those policy instruments designed to compensate for what is deemed to be a market failure in education. The market-based policy tools include vouchers, tuition tax credits, and the introduction of alternative style public schools such as charter schools, including many which are run by for-profit education management organizations (EMOs). According to various economic theories each of these should produce positive results. One proposed example would be that for-profit entity controlled charter schools would increase the supply of schools which would create competition which in turn would, so they say, improve the product. The data concludes that vouchers work in some conditions, but not all. The data is insufficient to draw conclusions about tax credits and the data on charter schools points to a lack of improvement. There seems to be some potential as far as these scholars are concerned, but that potential is a long way off. I am not surprised. As a student of economics I can readily say that the hyper-regulated and manipulated “markets” of American public schooling and taxation in America are not suited toward creation of competition to say the least. The potential is there, however, and I believe that due to the self-optimizing nature of nature, and people included, policy makers will soon learn that “less is more” when seeking to regulate toward competition. The tools for dealing with market failure are much more practical at the present time. They include increased accountability measures and Teacher Pay for Performance amongst other measures. In short the research shows that accountability is beneficial and Teacher Pay for Performance will also boost scores and such, as long as the money keeps flowing in. I believe both the “correct the market” and the “let the market work” mentalities will be maintained. They will work in concert to create a market which can work. Examples of the market working in education can already be seen in the recent take offs of the tutoring industry and home schools, especially with the unprecedented benefits of internet technology which educators seem dead set on underutilizing.</span></span></span></span></p>\\r\\nOther arguments for educational reform which are popular these days include the arguments for school choice. James Cox and Christopher Witko, for example, write on the interaction of educational reform and creation of social capital. These two scholars conclude that choosing school does not increase participation rates and is unlikely to increase social capital. (Cox and Witko) Smith and Meier note that not only does choice not seem to increase social capital, but it doesn’t seem to have any measurable benefit to education at all. (Smith and Meier) They note that choice encourages “cream skimming” which may give an illusion of improvement, but it really is only a form of self-segregation on behalf of the school choosers. We finally get into some better analysis with Smith’s later article, properly titled, “Data Don't Matter? Academic Research and School Choice.” As the name of the article implies, Smith affectively uncovers the great lack of respect for real data in the debate on choice. He uncovers an ideological divide which says is the real source of contention in the choice debate. He notes that, “Scholarly studies cannot decide what is the \\\"best\\\" or \\\"right\\\" ideology of education, no matter how hard partisans on both sides of the debate attempt to extract favorable ‘oughts’ from the ‘is’ of empirical studies.” (Smith) Because of the political nature of educational policy, and the fact that no clear moral right or wrong exists in this area, the policy will tend to be split just as the population those policies represent are split. Especially because the data indicates that there is very little difference in outcomes. This concept is further discussed by Amy Gutman. The introduction to her book <i>Back to Basics</i> opens with the statement, “When citizens rule in a democracy they determine, among other things, how future citizens will be educated.” (Gutman) This is the real crux of the matter. As long as the scholars have no definitive solution, the policies will continue to represent the diverse ideologies and political views of the democratic population. In the introduction Gutman discourages the avoidance of political topics in the name of scholarly work. She says that in the context of a democratically determined education system, education policy scholars <i>should</i> discuss the political issues involved as well as the practical social and educational ones. Furthermore the introduction notes the problems inherent in introducing top-down “liberal” approaches to education within a democratic system. One such problem would be a fracturing of the system, much like we see today. What the introduction does not note is that such fracturing, while it may create inefficiency, can also lead to long-term benefits by allowing us to see which ideas are best in experimental fashion. To summarize the results, school choice is here to stay. Not because it is beneficial, but because we live in a democratic system with public school policy being determined at the whim of a split voting group. This is neither good nor bad because of the fact that the produced results don’t change much either anyway. I prefer school choice because I prefer the ability to make my own decisions. This sort of moral argument is the only argument I feel carries water in light of the fact that neither method produces clearly better results.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast let’s look at Zero Tolerance policies. Two interesting articles take opposing views on the subject. Shanker takes the position that Zero Tolerance is necessary in order to send a clear message that students are responsible for their own behavior. (Shanker) He relates his argument to other common reform ideas such as vouchers by claiming that the reason vouchers are even necessary has more to do with safety than quality of education. Shanker says, “We are going to create a system of choice and vouchers so that 98 percent of the kids who behave can go some place and be safe…isn’t it ridiculous to move 98 percent of the kids when all you have to do is move two or three…?” His point is essentially that it is better to take a hard-line approach to dealing with the misbehaving students. He does distinguish between deadly violence and simple disruption, but he claims that they are both undesirable and Zero Tolerance is a suitable cure. Alfie Kohn disagrees with Shanker’s position. Kohn agrees that both deadly violence and simple disruption are not preferable but disagrees that Zero Tolerance is a suitable cure. (Kohn) It is worth noting that Kohn’s article came out in 2004 which is later than Shanker’s 1995 article. Kohn accesses a very different point of view in his article. It may be due to personal preference, or it may be due to the ability to observe the results of Zero Tolerance over time. Kohn states that ‘technical’ fixes, as he calls them, will not solve behavioral problems, despite the theories and intents behind it. He notes that ‘coercive means’ may stamp out the violence in schools, but it will not correct the underlying problem. I believe the ‘technical fixes’ and ‘coercive means’ would include Zero Tolerance. Kohn advocates that educators should not react to a disease by treating the symptoms, but rather, the underlying causes. He states, “…an educator’s first response should not be ‘Have we used sufficient force to stamp out this threat?’ but ‘What have we done to address the underlying issues here?...’” Kohn therefore prefers to advocate a change in school culture as a solution to the problems of school violence and disruption. Kohn says that creating the proper environment requires that students not be rated or ranked. Supposedly this will reduce tension and relax the students. While I disagree with Kohn’s recipe for a good school, I acknowledge his indication that Zero Tolerance doesn’t work to correct the underlying issue. Another article indicates that Zero Tolerance has been an extreme overreaction. A booklet from the think tank Texas Appleseed and primarily authored by Deborah Fowler accuses Zero Tolerance of being a pipeline for prison in Texas. (Fowler) The booklet describes the relatively recent trend of criminalization of student misbehavior. Personally I do not find the use of force <i>necessarily </i>bad in countering student misbehavior – the problem is the <i>degree</i> of force. As the article notes, proper punishment used to be, “…extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach…” The booklet says that now in some cases tasers and pepper spray are being used. I understand the need for force because, for example, the student may refuse to run the extra lap. The school might call a parent or suspend the student, but the parent might not care and the suspension might function more as a vacation than a punishment. The use of tasers and pepper spray on children, however, I find over the top. In addition the overrepresentation of special education students is outrageous. The overrepresentation is in terms of ticketed children. The problem of ticketing is what results in a prison pipeline. If the tickets are not paid they will stay on the child’s record through adulthood and later may result in imprisonment. The fact that school related tickets are not expunged like any other ticket is one major flaw in Zero Tolerance. Another is the fact that ticketing does not directly punish the student because child labor laws prevent most students from earning the money necessary to pay such tickets and therefore it is generally the parents or no one who pays the ticket. All these things point to systemic problems within Zero Tolerence and help to explain why it does not produce its desired result of dealing with the underlying causes of school violence and disruption. The problem is that there is no clear alternative to Zero Tolerance. While it may not be clear what the best policy to implement is, I feel comfortable concluding that Zero Tolerance as it stands must be either changed or done away with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion we have looked at three particular reforms from modern times. I believe that modern policy instruments in education are here to stay. I believe the market can work with education once proper conditions are set and some of these instruments are paving the way toward such conditions. School choice is here to stay, but not because it works. Rather, school choice is a necessary and proper outgrowth of the liberty and preference of the democratic American system of education policymaking. Finally, Zero Tolerance will change or fail. It is good that misbehaving students should be properly punished, and even with some force in extreme cases, but the way Zero Tolerance currently exists is hardly an image of proper punishment or use of force.\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<p align=\\\"CENTER\\\">Bibliography</p>\\r\\nTyack, David, and Larry Cuban. <i>Tinkering Towards Utopia</i>. 1995. 1-25.

    "title": "Was the Government Shutdown Good for the Job Market?",
    "date": "2013-11-10",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article will argue that it is possible the government shutdown was actually good for the job market.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/jobless-rate-rose-to-73percent-during-government-shutdown-economy-added-204k-jobs/2013/11/08/f51fa1de-481f-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html\\\">Washington Post</a> and many others report that in the month of October the US economy picked up tens of thousands of jobs more than were expected. The article goes on to talk about how the official unemployment rate is not the most reliable indicator of the job market, which is both and true and false. The official unemployment rate can be vastly improved with a few simple changes but it does still correlate with the real unemployment rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe October job rally could easily be chalked up to a fluke if it weren't so consistent with long-term trend data and economic theory which supports the idea that a government shutdown is good for the economy. Personally, I had previously expected that a theoretical government shutdown would have to last a month or longer for these theoretical beneficial effects to even begin to set in, but apparently this is not the case. Take a look at the trend data chart below then we will discuss some theory:\\r\\n\\r\\n<img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2240\\\" alt=\\\"Unemployment v spending\\\" src=\\\"http://afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Unemployment-v-spending.jpg\\\" width=\\\"479\\\" height=\\\"287\\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theoretical idea here is simple: Government does things less efficiently than the private sector. This is just another way of looking at that same simple idea. What these statistics show is that over time the unemployment rate moves with government spending as a % of GDP. Strictly speaking as a statistician, this only establishes correlation rather than causality, but let's take a further look.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be the case that the two factors are causally unrelated, spuriously related, or one causes the other. It's hard to see which factor occurs first, and I think it might vary at times, but take a look right about 1976 and you can see that federal spending there is the first effect. This supports the idea that spending comes first. Let's consider what usually happens under an increase in government spending. It negatively affects the private sector in two ways. On the one hand taxes, fees and whatever else the government uses to accrue revenue is a direct leech on the private sector, but not so fast! Sometimes the government spends money it doesn't take from the private sector directly. It can also print money and accrue national debt, using money from other nations to pay. In both of these cases the national currency is devalued which still involves indirectly damaging the private sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the government goes to execute selling or buying it also crowds out the private sector. Crowding out means  that it supplies a good, reducing the sales the private sector would have made, or it buys a good, bidding up the price for private sector would-be consumers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all these ways the government spending damages basic supply and demand. When government doesn't spend money it still creates a similar effect simply through regulating industry. The government doesn't have to crowd out business to hurt a business, it can simply tell the business that it has to do things a certain more expensive way and the industry will have a similar net effect, that effect being an increase to consumer prices, reduced industry revenues, increased unemployment and so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nJobs are an input into business production. Any time you hurt business you hurt jobs. This damage to jobs can occur one of three ways. It can result in decreased wages, decreased employment or a mix. It is usually a mix. So in free market economic theory, when a government does pretty much anything it comes at a cost to jobs, either in the form of decreased wages or decreased employment or a mix. The government shutdown resulting in an unexpected increase to jobs can be seen to confirm this. While in theory it's possible, in reality the government almost never creates jobs on net. The government obviously creates jobs, but the less obvious fact is that if those jobs didn't exist there would be a larger number of jobs in the private sector to make up for it.",

Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis drew just under 7 percent of the vote. The result was far closer than expected, as most public polls forecast a comfortable lead for McAuliffe.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>In a brutally negative campaign, McAuliffe pulled out his narrow victory with a massive financial advantage and by painting Cuccinelli as an extreme social conservative. The Democrat also took advantage of Cuccinelli’s refusal to condemn the Republican tactics that led to the government shutdown. The issue was particularly potent in Northern Virginia, where many residents work for the government or for government contractors.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>By contrast, Cuccinelli sought to focus on McAuliffe’s business deals and to turn the race into a referendum on Obamacare, which Cuccinelli has steadily opposed. While the strategy rallied ardent Republicans to his banner, it also may have energized some Democrats.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The presence of a strong libertarian candidate also played a significant role in the race. Cuccinelli had Ron Paul headline his election-eve rally, and the Republican nominee spent far more time ignoring suburban swing voters in favor of wooing disgruntled libertarians than would have been ideal. While Sarvis only ended up polling about 6.5 percent, he had polled at more than 10 percent at times.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The defection of many Republicans, particularly those in the donor class, helped McAuliffe put together a whopping financial advantage.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>McAuliffe also put together a far more effective ground operation than Cuccinelli, led by veteran Democratic organizer Robby Mook. During the governor-elect’s victory speech, he bragged that his campaign had knocked on 2.5 million doors since January, and he went out of his way to praise his field staff.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>McAuliffe said his own differences with Cuccinelli and the GOP were “differences of opinion, not differences of principle.” Even when McAuliffe was noting that Virginians supported his “mainstream approach,” he emphasized that he was following predecessors of both parties, including Republican Gov.

McAuliffe’s campaign, which severely limited his exposure to the media knowing his tendencies to, for lack of a better term, “be Terry,” also deserves a huge amount of credit for keeping him reined in. McAuliffe won for lots of reasons, but one of the big ones is that he ran a very steady and solid campaign — from manager Robby Mook to pollsters Fred Yang and Geoff Garin to media consultants Saul Shorr and Adam Magnus.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>More than four in 10 voters in the Virginia exit poll identified themselves as moderate and McAuliffe won that group by 21 points over Cuccinelli. Half of the New Jersey electorate identified as moderates and Christie won them by 24 points. In each case, moderates proved decisive in the final margin.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>?Fairfax County is so large in terms of population that it has become virtually conclusive for Republicans statewide. Break even and you will almost certainly win. Let the Democratic nominee roll up somewhere between 57 percent and 60 percent and you almost certainly lose.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Cuccinelli won by seven points among voters who said the economy was the most important issue in their vote. Cuccinelli won by six points among voters who said health care was the most important factor in their vote. He lost by 25 points among voters who said that abortion was their key voting issue. The simple fact is that Cuccinelli let himself be defined as a warrior for social issues.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Cuccinelli won independents by nine points while Mitt Romney won them by 11 in Virginia and by five nationwide. Both candidates lost. Many independents may well be Republicans-in-hiding rather than true fence-sitters. Judging by Tuesday night’s results, moderates are the key swing group, not independents.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>A majority of Virginia voters said that “government is doing too many things.” And this is in Virginia where the federal government is by far the biggest employer in electorally critical Northern Virginia. The antipathy toward government overreach is a message that Republicans nationally would do well to latch onto heading into 2014, particularly if the Obamacare rollout remains as rocky as it has been.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Source: <a href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/07/robert-sarvis-didnt-cost-ken-cuccinelli-the-virginia-governors-race/\\\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/07/robert-sarvis-didnt-cost-ken-cuccinelli-the-virginia-governors-race/</a>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>Many Republicans blame Libertarian nominee Robert Sarvis for Cuccinelli's loss.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>That thinking is wrong according to exit polling by Edison Media Research.

    "date": "2014-01-21",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article will cover the importance of recognition of the heterogeneous quality of information and how that relates to market competition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHot on the heels of MLK Day, let's talk about another kind of diversity. Information is diverse. Even seemingly identical information is not really identical. Consider that you and I both look at a tree. We identify the tree and its various characteristics. It's 7 feet tall, yields apples, has green leaves and a very wide, in our shared opinion, trunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe agree on everything about the tree, but are we really considering the exact same information? I may have looked at the tree from a different angle. If the tree is fruit bearing, we may have inspected different fruits of the tree and still come to the same conclusion about the tree. We agree that the trunk is very wide, but why? Is my history of observed tree trunks <em>exactly</em> the same as yours, or only <em>similar</em>? I would guess that our information is similar, but still heterogeneous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be that identical information may be produced through a computer or some other process, but it seems likely that no two <em>people</em> are in possession of identical stored information profiles. This diversity of information is both beautiful and a pain at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is beautiful because this is how markets process so much information at one time with such minimal bias and maximal accuracy. Consider pairs of people with very different stored information profiles; people of different religions, different professional expertise, different cultural upbringing or different formal education. When people who think in very different ways approach the same problem and come to some solution, at least three important things happen:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Multiple solutions may be produced instead of one.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>When a single solution is found to be exhaustive or optimal by diverse parties, it is more valid because it is less biased than when a single solution is found to be exhaustive or optimal by homogeneous parties or individuals.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>More information may be processed more quickly, resulting in quicker problem solving or superior problem solving in a given period. Greater potential (information/time).</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nIt may even be a good idea to play perfectionist, critic or Devil's advocate with your own ideas. Take an opposing view simply to see if your idea is valid across different viewpoints, or if it depends on something you believe which others do not. Be careful, however, because you are not really taking the opposing view. That is fundamentally impossible. What you are taking is your biased perception of the opposing view. This technique of self-criticism is useful, but it doesn't always compare well to the real deal of letting someone else critique your ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, diversity can be a pain. Consider that you want to hire a computer technology specialist for a company. You have two applicants with very, very different credentials, but you can only hire one. How on earth can you tell how will do a better job? They may have different skills, different educations, different experience and so forth. They may be asking different salaries. Which is the better ROI (return on investment, as measured by performance/pay)? Diversity can make problems like this extremely complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why we as people often engage in categorization, labeling, modeling, generalizing and, yes, even stereotyping. Psychologists, the politically correct and others sometimes speak ill of these ways of thinking, but if these ways of thinking are always bad why do we keep doing them? I think the answer is that like most things, these actions are not always bad. They are sometimes bad and sometimes good. These kinds of thinking and acting can be useful for solving otherwise complex problems. It's all about expected value and it's a rational action.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have no way of knowing the exact education Jim and Joe, the two people trying to get this computer specialist job, received. I do know that Jim went to a school which has a bad reputation and Joe went to a school with a good reputation. I do know that they both received a BS of Comp Sci and had 3.4 GPAs. Are all BS of Comp Sci equal? Are all 3.4 GPAs equal? Of course not! However, we generalize because we have no further information to act on. Does a school with a bad reputation prove that a student received a lower quality education? Certainly not, but it's all about <em>expected value</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be the case that Joe partied at Harvard and did not really receive the education indicated by his GPA. Maybe he cheated. Maybe Jim would do a better job than Joe. These are all possibilities, but at the end of the day Joe is going to get this job because of my perception of the value of each of these guys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs our example just pointed out, these small calculations can be erroneous. I think the interesting thing is that although these calculations using generalizations can be erroneous, they are in reality usually not erroneous. That leads to a whole other discussion. Perhaps it's survival of the fittest or some high quality intelligent design?",

    "title": "The Definition of Money",
    "date": "2014-04-16",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "I just realized I haven't actually posted an article defining money. Or at least I can't find one on my own site. Anyway, here is one.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>The Classical Definition</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nMoney is classically defined as having three essential elements. Money is a:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unit_of_account&amp;oldid=550288808\\\">Unit of Account</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Store_of_value&amp;oldid=603102954\\\">Store of Value</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medium_of_exchange&amp;oldid=604067997\\\">Medium of Exchange</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nMoney is the thing you give to people in exchange for other things. Clearly then, it is a medium of exchange. It is also a store of value because nothing would be given in exchange for money if it did not have a value. That is not to say that the value of money cannot fluctuate; indeed, it can. Rather, it is to say that at all times money is money, it has some value.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposite is also true, anything which has value can be used as money so long as it can be traded. Money need not be currency, legal tender or charta. Currency is a good which is not significantly useful outside of its role as money. Other goods, however, such as precious metals, can be both currency and otherwise useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good which can be used in its own right or be employed significantly well as money is called a <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commodity_money&amp;oldid=597005986\\\">commodity money</a>. Throughout history there have been a range of commodity monies including precious metals, shells, alcohol and cigarettes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, money is a unit of account. By virtue of a transaction, whatever is given as money can be considered a unit. The single unit may be further divisible, but it need not be. A tautological characteristic of account is established. As we will see, further divisibility is desirable but is not at first necessary in the definition of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last note before I continue. The idea that money serves as a unit of account and stores value means that there is a finite supply of money. If there were an infinite supply of money, no particular amount of money could hold value or provide a meaningful measure of account.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last last note: The economist's definition of money is not always the same as the legal or institutional definition of some organization such as a bank and so on. The economist's definition of money is more useful for understanding how economies work, and dare I say a more accurate definition in general, but as a matter of practice you should always understand the practical definition of money used by whatever organization with which you are interacting. Often, currency.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>\\\"Good Money\\\" vs Money</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's clear that there is a large range of things which can in a technical sense be referred to as money according to the classical definition. Conceivably, any transferable thing could be considered money. Even information can be considered money under the right conditions!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an aside, the idea that information could act as money does not contradict the idea that there must be a finite supply of money. There is actually a finite supply of information in the universe. Mind blowing, I know. I digress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile money can be many things, not all money is created equal. There are a variety of factors which are outside of the definition of money, but still make money more or less useful in practice. These include:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>Divisibility - A single unit may be converted into multiple, smaller units, without compromising the value of any unit.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fungibility&amp;oldid=603641106\\\">Fungibility</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li>Verifiable - Sometimes called \\\"recognizable,\\\" or \\\"recognisability,\\\" especially in academic works. In industry (the money services industry, that is), this is referred to as verification or identifiability. When money is verifiable it means that the money is easily recognizable as money, and that it intrinsically combats fraud including counterfeiting.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Transportable - High value per weight, high value per size, even a lack of legal inhibition to locomotion all fall into this category. Money must be transferable. Good money is easily transferable. Being transportable often makes transfer easier.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Commonly used - Similar to being verifiable, but importantly related to the network effect.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Predictable Value - Earlier I said money should store value, but that the value could change. Ideally, the value would change in a predictable way so as to provide consistency with the free market principal of free information.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Many others - In fact, the list is infinite. Any</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nThere is debate about whether money should be stable (Hayek), inflationary or deflationary. I think the only thing we can be certain of, as noted above, is that predictably valued money is ideal, even if the ideal direction of that predictable change is not yet settled.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a fan of a constant money supply. This creates a natural deflationary pressure, of which I am a fan. I am not a fan of accelerated or unnatural deflation, such as might occur under a central bank which reduces the money supply. Moreover, I would assert that in the long run money will be deflationary because, as earlier noted, there is a maximum amount of information in the universe, eventually capping the amount of money, even if at some astronomically large level.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also like free-market and competing currencies and banking systems. Even if a natural deflation is not ideal and I am wrong, I am confident the market will sort it out before any individual, group of scholars, or central bank does.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I recommend the following two sources for further inquiry:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Money&amp;oldid=603449502\\\">Wikipedia: Money</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://economics.about.com/cs/studentresources/f/money.htm\\\">What Is Money?</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>",

    "title": "Which Market?",
    "date": "2014-04-22",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article plugs a couple scholars, comments on intra-firm geographical dispersion and notes multiple definitions of market.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep an eye out for the fourthcoming paper from <a href=\\\"http://cbpp.georgetown.edu/staff/j-bradford-jensen/\\\">J. Bradford Jensen</a> and A. Gervais on intra-firm geographical dispersion and its relationship to <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_direct_investment&amp;oldid=604136031\\\">foreign direct investment</a>. Note that FDI refers to economic investment by a firm in a non-native country, not the financial investment act of taking on foreign investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of possibly unclear definitions, I was made aware of different academic definitions of \\\"market\\\" at Jensen's presentation today. Different academic definitions of an economic market:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Geographic area serviced - by region, by number of establishments and other operationalizations.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Industry serviced</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Product mix produced</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Some combination</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nOstensibly, if geographic area distinguishes a market then time does so as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, Jensen had a great presentation and his paper was very interesting. His study seems to focus on estimation of the importance of the number of firm establishments of plants in relation to Foreign Direct Investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo points I made are 1: If there were no trade barriers then we would still expect a distribution by logistical costs. He very much agreed, but I don't think I was clear about the fact that I meant that this would imply that FDI becomes equivalent to investment at that point; the market can no longer be distinguished as 'foreign' in the absence of trade policy costs. The second point I made, or perhaps merely hypothesized, was that plant/establishment numbers matters today, and it did yesterday, but it will not tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a shallow way this is due to the economic shift toward information technology as time goes on. In information technology, establishment/plant number doesn't matter, because transportation/logistical costs are near 0. A single plant or establishment can provide for worldwide production, purchase and sale. Moreover, Info tech as an industry is moving to entirely displace other industries. As 3D printing emerges, even manufacturing is becoming digitized, and manufacturing is one of those sectors where plant number is currently critically important.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore deeply, the optimal plant number will converge in the long run to 1 plant per firm, and in fact 1 person per firm, due to the distributive efficiency of markets. Now, this is a long run phenomenon which we are a long way from, but the point remains. We have seen the move from the era states to the era of corporations to the era of consultants. Now we are a foot in the era of consultants and a foot in the era of networks. After networks we will enter the era of individuals, due to reasons of the distributive efficiency of markets. Remember, this is not an effect to be caused. Markets are self-optimizing. It's just gonna happen, simple as that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Jensen's work can get us a baseline for the importance of plant number. We can repeat his work some other time and get a feel for the move of this importance over time. This will lead to an approximate discovery of the rate of approach toward this long-term equilibrium! That, I think, is very interesting. I would hypothesize that we are moving toward an 1 person, 1 plant, 1 firm ideal size with a nonlinear approach toward that equilibrium.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis paper should be out in the next year-ish. Keep in mind that this article is largely my thoughts, so please don't blame him for any nonsense! The guy is sharp.",

Writing less than the minimum means you are lacking important pieces, and writing more than the full plan means you are writing fluff with no real added value.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically the point of a marketing plan is to identify who might want what you have, and to drive 3 actions:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Let them know you have it.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Make them want more.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Make more of them want it.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nBefore I discuss the specific plans, here are some sources from which these plans are built:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/davelavinsky/2013/09/30/marketing-plan-template-exactly-what-to-include/\\\">[Forbes] Marketing Plan Template: Exactly What To Include</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.dexmedia.com/blog/10-steps-to-marketing-plan-success/\\\">10 Steps to Marketing Plan Success</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy\\\">Marketing strategy</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marketing_plan\\\">Marketing plan</a></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Minimum Viable Marketing Plan (\\\"MVMP\\\")</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nContains the following:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Executive Summary</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Product Description</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Target Consumer Profile</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Competitive Assessment</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Available Resources Assessment</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Recommended Promotional Mix</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Full Marketing Plan</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll get to this some other time.

    "title": "The Real Link Between Technology and Entrepreneurship",
    "date": "2014-06-07",

    "content": "In the mind of American culture, and perhaps other cultures as well, technology and <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship\\\">entrepreneurship</a> are inextricably linked.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne usual explanation is the idea of particularly creative people. These creative people are into creating new inventions and are also able to successfully launch a business due to the same creativity. Another explanation is that technology enables people. With better technology comes the ability to do things new ways, or do old things with more ease, less risk, or some other factor which now allows businesses to grow which previously couldn't.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese explanations both work in part but they are not exhaustive. I do not claim to have an exhaustive list either, but I can bring us one step closer to it. The explanation which is seldom discussed is the regulatory reason technology and entrepreneurship are linked.\\r\\n\\r\\nInnovation is hard to regulate. Old technologies have become understood and can be regulated, but new technology is often not understood well enough to regulate. In some cases a new technology may apply to an existing product. These innovations are somewhat easier to regulate compared to the case of the <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/theoretical-development-and-application/importance-moral-information/\\\">double-innovation</a>, of which bitcoin has been a great recent example, but still harder to regulate than an old and understood product.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, the less understood something is, the harder it is to regulate. Mystery cannot be regulated, innovation is next to mystery, and mystery is always there. This can give us hope that the free market will win the battle against the State.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccepting that innovation is hard to regulate, the point is that innovation now seems extremely profitable. It is profitable enough to have a temporary monopoly and a first-to-market advantage, along with the entrenched brand recognition and market-share advantages that come along with the others and would serve any business for years. Now consider that there is also a relatively lower cost of business when we bring technology into the picture, because you will suffer less regulatory costs as an innovator.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe State is subsidizing its own death through opportunity cost by regulating non-innovation so heavily!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make this clearer, keep in mind that an innovator is different from an entrepreneur. The entrepreneur need not innovate at all. He or she could enter into an established market. This may seem unprofitable to an economist, but any student of business knows that copying from a proven business model has advantages including risk-elimination benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the entrepreneur could innovate or not. Ceteris paribus, if regulatory costs are higher only in the case that the entrepreneur chooses not to innovate, then the entrepreneur has a motivation to innovate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is an additional reason that innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship are linked!",

    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This website is dedicated to post-economic learning. In line with that type of learning, although it may seem contrary to some, I often write about religious or philosophical issues. This article will make clear that this type of writing is related to economics for at least 4 reasons:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Economic Morality</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The Economic Argument for God</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The Philosophical Underpinnings of All Science</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The Special Role of Philosophy in Economics</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Economic Morality</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Economic Morality\\\" is not an economic concept. It is a philosophical concept, and one which I am not strongly convinced of as a matter of necessity. It is very useful in most activities, however, and that is why many people abide by it and are interested in it. Economic Morality is the idea that we should do that which is most efficient. Perhaps closely related is an idea I would call Economic Inevitability, which is the idea that in the long run everything will be done in the way that is most efficient by reasons of Economic Law, regardless of the preferential or moral questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Economic Morality calls into the discussion greater questions of morality and philosophy because it is an interesting and complex issue. Should we do that which is most efficient? The answer is often yes, but the possibility of the answer being no is quite interesting and not clear cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between economics and libertarianism is an example of the relationship between economics and counterpart morality.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, the point of After Econ is to answer the question, \\\"After I have learned economics, what should I do?\\\" Prima facie this a question of how to derive morality from economics. At second glance, however, this is easily a much more general question of morality.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>The Economic Argument for God</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated to the idea of Economic Law is the Economic Argument for God. This argument is a variant of the Fine-Tuning Argument. This argument holds that Economic Law is finely tuned and teleological, much like the various laws of physics are argued to be. This argument is not to be confused with Pascal's Argument, variants of which are something like a rational actor argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economic Argument for God, or the Argument from Economic Law, may be frequently or clearly discussed, but it is a subject which greatly intrigues me. It is an argument which is at once both subject to economic, logical, and religious interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>The Philosophical Underpinnings of All Science</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nAll science is in a sense merely Applied Philosophy. Most hard sciences are almost exclusively examples of Applied Positivism. Other schools of philosophy swirl around the other branches of academia and soft science. Economics, of course, has a foot in each world. Some schools of economics are purely positive while other are built on mostly or perhaps entirely subjectivist, non-positivist, grounds. Taken holistically, then, economics is at once a hard and a soft science, depending on the particular applied approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe philosophical underpinnings of all science is no small matter and it is nothing to be ignored in anything which amounts to a serious discussion of science, or economics in particular. Positivism itself is an interesting issue, not without objection. Even without objection, however, it is still something to take note of. Having a proper understanding of positivism is important to properly interpret the outcomes of any scientific endeavor, just as understanding any framework is important for carrying out any application of that knowledge. To do otherwise would be akin to join in a football game with no knowledge of the rules. You may get lucky and learn on the fly, purely by application with no special study, but you will almost certainly be better off taking the other approach which is to learn beforehand by specifically knowing the formal rules, best practices, and so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience, then, is a subset of philosophy. It makes sense to extend a discussion of economics into a greater discussion of philosophy in some cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>The Special Role of Philosophy in Economics</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said, Economics has a foot in each world. That is, the world of hard and soft science. Related to this fact is the other fact that philosophy plays a special role in economics. It is a role which philosophy does not play in most other sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some schools of economics, though not all, economic questions can be purely answered through a priori reasoning and deductive logic. In Austrian Economics this is a major practice. Praxeology, a foundation of Austrian Economics, is built on axiomatic logic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it is not the mainstream approach of the science, Austrian Economics does compromise a significant player in the world of economics and therefore philosophy comes into proper discussion significantly more often, in my opinion, than it would in something like Chemistry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, while I am not an Austrian, I am specifically and personally interested in possible unification of the ideas of the Austrians with Friedmanian thought. Perhaps for that reason we get into a bit more philosophy here than the average economist might, while the average economist is perhaps already involved with philosophy more often than the average scientist for reasons previously discussed.",

    "title": "Quantified Ordinal Modelling of Action",
    "date": "2014-07-26",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article builds on quantified ordinal modelling theory which I have talked about in the past. Here, I apply quantified ordinal modelling to human action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis allows us to predict an actual decision by an actor. It is not necessarily an optimal decision, but it is a prediction of the actual decision the actor will make. This article will take the form of a discussion between me and <a href=\\\"http://academy.mises.org/moodle/user/view.php?id=1016&amp;course=190\\\">Nathanael Stover</a> because it is an actual discussion which took place on the academic forums of Mises University 2014. This post will use summaries in some cases.\\r\\n<div class=\\\"no-overflow\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"content\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"posting fullpost\\\"><strong>Me:</strong>Klein spoke about the difficulty of modelling their actions as calculable actions. I think we can model them, although weakly, in the following way:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>If A occurs on some probability and we do not know what probability, the rational expectation is a probability of 50%. This minimizes error.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>If we know A occurs more often than B, but we do not know what probability B occurs on, the rational expectation is that A occurs on a 75% probability. This is because we assume B on 50% we know A occurs more probably than B, but we don't know how much more ofter, so again we assume 50%.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nI think this logic applies to Case Probability. I think this is very much the intuitive approach entrepreneurs take, even without thinking about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the intuitive approach involves gut feelings, subconscious calculations, and conscious calculations with a low degree of confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"forumpost clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"row maincontent clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"no-overflow\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"content\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"posting fullpost\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\nIntuitive statements may include, \\\"I think this is going to happen,\\\" or \\\"I feel like this is going to happen.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs [another poster] point[s] out, the entrepeneur's action shows an expectation or belief that doing X is better than doing 'X, although that expectation may not match with reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"forumpost clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"row maincontent clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"left\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"grouppictures\\\"><strong>Stover:</strong></div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"no-overflow\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"content\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"posting fullpost\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn, It sometimes is possible to quantify class probabilities, but you are describing case probabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot assume that there are only two options. What if there are three or an unknown number of options? Often entrepreneurs have an infinite number of factors contributing to the success or failure of a given endeavor and they may be faced with a huge number of results that could be achieved depending on the market. As you and other posters here mention, entrepreneurs use “gut feeling”, but I would rather describe it as judgment involving an educated and experienced understanding of the market and industry and literally thousands of variables and factors that contribute to this unique case in front of the entrepreneur today.\\r\\n\\r\\nMath has some uses, but I do not think it has any use here. The judgments entrepreneurs make may be based in part on quantitative risk assessments, data summaries, financial ratios, and accounting analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Me:</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"forumpost clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"row maincontent clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"no-overflow\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"content\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"posting fullpost\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for your response. This conversation is quickly becoming complex, but here are some partial answers. Please pardon my Twitter-style verse:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>I am describing case pro, not class. I am arguing we can still quantify, despite the usual thought otherwise.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>We needn't assume 2 options. This was for simplicity. It works for an arbitrary length scale of information. They key is that it is an ordinal, not cardinal, process. This method of quant even works without cardinal information.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Me and other posters use \\\"gut feeling\\\" or \\\"intuitive approach\\\" because this is the language of Klein in his talk and the Austrians writ large.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>I agree, the intuitive approach involves education, experience, etc. Yes it can involve many complex factors.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Utilizing data to make a judgement about the future can be very much, though I grant you not entirely, quantitative. Yet all of this was precisely what I was NOT referring to. Finance ratios, etc may be called a \\\"formal estimation.\\\" I was referring to a gut-feeling, intuitive, \\\"informal estimation.\\\" This estimation does not involve prior data, but logical process and even physical feeling. Yet my key point here is that this logical process, even without cardinal information, can create posterior data through my ordinal approach.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>To illustrate: Let's say I don't know the price of A, nor do I know the price of B, but I do know that A costs less than B. You can see that this could not be useful in formal estimation. We can logically deduce, however, that A \\\"probably costs about half of B.\\\" This is an informal estimate, but it is mathematically and logically valid. It even holds if we don't KNOW A costs less than B. Maybe we just feel like, expect, best-guess, etc. that A costs less than B. Still holds.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"row side\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"forumpost clearfix\\\"><strong>Stover:</strong>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"row maincontent clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"no-overflow\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"content\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"posting fullpost\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn, I feel like we are not talking about the same thing. I cannot visualize an entrepreneur making a decision based on what you describe, so could you give me a concrete example? Thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am talking about a case probability of profiting on a specific entrepreneurial project.\\r\\n\\r\\nActually, using a number like 75% could be confusing because it encourages the use of mathematical calculations on a decision that is not mathematical at all. Will I use 75% to make a projection of the future value of this project? How would a quantification of entrepreneurial decisions be used? Would there be any connection between the numbers and reality? For example, I am an investor. Entrepreneur Jim has three projects A&gt;B&gt;C. Thus if I understand your methodology, A(88%)&gt;B(75%)&gt;C(50%). Entrepreneur Sue has projects S&gt;T, so S(75%)&gt;T(50%). What good are these percentages to me as an investor looking at the 5 projects? Is A(88%) better than S(75%)? What if Sue is a better entrepreneur than Jim? I cannot think of any value to having numbers like these. I cannot see any connection to reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps if you showed me a concrete example, that would help? I don’t know.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Me:</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"forumpost clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"row maincontent clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"no-overflow\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"content\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"posting fullpost\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to see you have at least partly understood my method. Yes, A(88%)&gt;B(75%)&gt;C(50%) with respect to Jim and S(75%)&gt;T(50%) with respect to Sue.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever it does not necessarily follow that S &gt; C. It could be the case that such a statement is true, but it would not prima facie be expected. The two value scales are not necessarily compatible because Joe and Sue are expected to value projects in different ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Joe and Sue value projects in precisely the same way, it might be true that S &gt; C, but this is a seperate question. Joe would have to consider S and T and place them into his scale of A, B, and C, then Sue would do similarly, and it might turn out that they produce the same whole-event scales at the end of the day, but this would not at all be obvious at first.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unlikely that Joe will value S and T to 75% and 50% as Sue did because that would mean P(T) = P(C) and P(B) = P(S). In the real world, having exactly equal probabilities for complex events is extremely rare. It is more likely that Joe will value P(T) &gt; P(C) or P(T) &lt; P(C) and so on. Although it is theoretically possible that he would say P(T) ~ = P(C).\\r\\n\\r\\nA concrete example would be Joe's 2 investment possibilities are Microsoft or Walmart stock. Sarah's 2 investment possibilities are Office Depot or Exxon Gas stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe intuitively feels like (based on experience, education....but NOT based on formal evaluation through P/E ratios, etc.) Microsoft has a better reputation and therefore he thinks it's more undervalued. In short, he thinks investing in Microsoft will probably produce more ROI. Let P(X) be the expected ROI from investing in X. Joe's gut says P(M) &gt; P(W).\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah thinks that Exxon Gas is better than Office Depot. Again, this is her opinion, not the result of some equation. Her gut says P(E) &gt; P(O).\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes it follow that P(M) &gt; P(O)? It might, but it would involve adding information to the question which we do not yet have. This is because intuitive values are <em>respective of the evaluator.</em> Sarah cannot have Joe's opinion for him and vice versa. It might be the case that they would have precisely the same opinion when they consider the other companies, but that would not be obvious based on our current information. I would expect that people usually have different intuitions, opinions, subjective valuations and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, to answer \\\"Is P(M) &gt; P(O)?\\\" One of three things must happen:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Joe must consider M, W, P, and O. (Intuitive for Joe, not Sarah.)</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Sarah must consider M, W, P, and O. (Intuitive for Sarah, not Joe.)</li>\\r\\n\t<li>We must consider some objective standard which evaluates M, W, P, and O. (Non-intuitive approach).</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nLastly, the intuitive approach does not refer to the optimal action. It refers to the expected action. When Joe considers various possibilities, he will chose the one he thinks is most beneficial. This does not mean it is the one which actually is most beneficial.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be the case that Joe or Sarah is a better entrepeneur. In my opinion this would mean that either Joe or Sarah more frequently acts in a way that is consistent with their objectively optimal action, and I do think such an action exists.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Stover:</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\nWarren Buffet could say: \\\"Project P is 99% and Project D is a 85%.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOr Warren Buffet could simply state: \\\"P has a very strong competitive advantage compared to D, but D is also a strong company with a very innovative and flexible leadership team.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first statement has quantified Buffet’s subjective opinion on P and D, but does that have any advantage over the second statement? Is this the type of use you were thinking about when you described this theory?\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Me:</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecisely! I think in some contexts the number would be better and in other contexts the number would be less helpful than the specific, subjective opinion. The opinion might be better because it contains additional information. For example, how the business might go about improving and why\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number is also helpful because it helps us answer the question, \\\"What would Buffet actually do?\\\" The answer is he would pick Project P of the two. This is not clear merely from the subjective language.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I think economics benefits from the ability to translate back and forth.",

    "date": "2014-09-19",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "In thinking about the relationship between Christianity and Economics, it is interesting to consider the possibility of adapting a style of Christian apologetics into an approach to economics thought. The particular style this article is concerned with is the idea of <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presuppositional_apologetics&amp;oldid=622832804\\\">presuppositionalism</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, presuppositionalism argues for Christianity by attempting to prove the absurdity of the contrary. The presuppositionalist argues that we must presuppose the truth of Christianity to have any rational claim to knowledge, logic, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe approach I have generally taken in my previous discussions on Christianity and Economics is to look at one of two things:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>Looking at Christianity and economics independently, do they overlap? If so, where, why, and how?</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Looking at Christianity and economics dependently, does economics imply anything about Christianity? Does it provide evidence? Does it strengthen or weaken certain interpretations?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nPresuppositionalist economics would take the following approach, which I have done from time to time as well:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>Looking at Christianity and economics dependently, and assuming Christianity is true, does Christianity imply anything about economics? Does it strengthen or weaken certain theories or models?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nThis seems to be a complex and interesting subject. I think the answer is clearly, \\\"Yes, Christianity implies certain things about economics.\\\" However I certainly don't have an exhaustive list at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo things crossed my mind early on:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>The Bible talks about <a href=\\\"http://thegospelcoalition.org/article/you-asked-does-god-harden-a-believers-heart/\\\">hardeness of the heart</a>. In the Bible the heart is used in part to signify where sincere beliefs are conducted. The idea of hardness of the heart, then, relates to what we might call in economics the elasticity of belief, or the willingness to change beliefs.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The Bible talks about a form of utility where the person is not necessarily maximizing their own utility, but the utility of Christ in them. I have discussed this in previous articles.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nWe could envision an experimental design to see what sorts of things change this elasticity. In affect, do some things make a person more or less open minded? Two theories might be what I would call the isolation theory and the propaganda theory:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>The isolation theory holds that a person becomes more open minded when they are away from other people, particularly in a state of nature.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The propaganda theory holds that if a person is exposed to only one kind of information, over time they are more likely to accept that information.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nOne experimental design would be to have subjects voluntarily engage in a weekend of isolation, or in a weekend of isolation with a single book.",

He then states that if there is any point which we find ourselves questioning the value of the treatment, we must be for rationing.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">The rationing being discussed at the time was government healthcare rationing, which is non-voluntary and fundamentally different from rationing which occurs in the private world.</span></li>\\r\\n\t<li>When government regulates health care it is now free to kill and let live whom it pleases. At first we can imagine an attempt at fairness. Then there will quickly be the realization that not everyone can live and so decisions on who to kill will have to be made. Here's the problem - those decisions will be political and inescapable when the government rations health care. Disagree? Great, you get to be next in line.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Public rationing of health care is second of all inefficient. Many needless lives would be lost.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Government guaranteeing of health care is equivalent to slavery. They are claiming the right to coerce practitioners into supplying the good. Doctors and medical practitioners already have a hard life, and they are some of our best people intellectually and morally. It would not be right to enslave anyone, least of all these people.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>There seems to be the idea that no action is ever voluntary when it comes to health care. People are always willing to consume more, regardless of price. They are essentially up against a wall as it were, with no real choice. I think this is nonsense. People are willing to endanger themselves for various kinds of gains, whether financial or otherwise. This is the exact way we are able to calculate the economic value of a life by revealed preference, because people do reveal some preference for the risk of death.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Furthermore, the implied idea that no person would ever sacrifice their own life for their neighbor is offensive. Did the author just imply that the entire human race is hypocritical and selfish? Maybe the author is, but I know men and women in our military, in dangerous but non-military peacekeeping roles, in health services, and in religious service, all of whom are willing to unselfishly sacrifice for the benefit of others.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Finally, I do not appreciate the author's likening of the recipient of health care to prostitutes haggling about price. As previously mentioned, higher prices are equal to higher deaths in this industry, so haggling about price is not to be belittled. The author's comparison indicates that even to engage in the haggling is beside the point, from which it would logically follow that the number of lives saved is beside the point. I couldn't agree less.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nQuote 2: \\\"If you’re a nonsmoker in the market for life insurance, you should be thankful for cigarettes. They help keep your rates down.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLandsburg, Steven E. (2007-11-01). The Armchair Economist (revised and updated May 2012): Economics &amp; Everyday Life (p. 25). Free Press. Kindle Edition.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>I love this chapter! Landsburg does a great job of explaining one of the most powerful aspects of economics - indicators and signals - using plain English. This quote did puzzle me. Even though I am perfectly familiar with these ideas, I was admittidly confused by such an opening to the chapter.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>There is a key element of economics and of markets which is necessary for the ideas discussed in this chapter to function, and the author succesfully discusses this element. This is the element of voluntary action. For signals and indicators be correctly generated and utilized on the market, the actions in that market must be voluntary. This flies directly in the face of the first quoted article, \\\"Why We Must Ration Health Care\\\" because, as discussed, when health care is rationed via public policy rather than private arrangements it is not voluntary.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nQuote 3: \\\"Retrospective reimbursement removes any incentive for providers to treat their patients cost-effectively.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGruber, Jonathan (2012-12-01). Public Finance and Public Policy (Page 445). Worth Publishers. Kindle Edition.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>In the first place the statement is not accurate. Retrospective reimbursement is still constrained by the maximum reimbursement offered. It could be argued that the provider has no incentive to treat the patient at less than the cost of the maximum reimbursement, but this is also false, and even if it were not false it is very different from the original quote.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The provider does have two additional incentives not to engage in unnecissary treatment. The first incentive is that unnecissary treatment drives away customers and the second incentive is reputation which may be improved or damaged by how a practice is handled, whether consumers leave or not.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>It also seems that there is no winning here for the private market. If the market produces an outcome of medical product which is tightly coupled with minimal prices then the market is being selfish, merciless against the interest of the sick and the poor. If it produces an outcome in which product is more loosely coupled with price then the market is still being selfish, trying to earn as much money as possible without caring about whether certain procedures are necessary! These problems do exist, but they are minimized through the private market rather than government interference.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The book does well to discuss prospective reimbursement and other models of insurance. Each, including retrospective reimbursement, has unique benefits and problems. The deregulated market is in an information-maximizing position to find the best balance of which models to use, and also to allow maximum growth in innovation. The very fact that there is currently no good, single model should be a red flag to indicate that any particular public policy based in any particular modern model is bound to bring problems.</li>\\r\\n</ul>",

    "title": "The Halo Effect and Unconscious Accuracy",
    "date": "2014-10-14",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Halo_effect&amp;oldid=628757205\\\">The Halo Effect</a> is a cognitive bias in which a person, A, is more likely to believe that another person, B, is good in some respect, D, if they are known to be good in some other respect, C, even in the absence of independent or observed evidence that B is in fact good with respect to D.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the Halo Effect is a real cognitive bias is usually employed to imply that some person is more likely to make a faulty conclusion because of the Halo Effect. After all, bias usually implies error. However, the Halo Effect is an example of positive bias. This is because, as a matter of fact, people are often actually marginally better with respect to some random quality B if they are known in the first place to be good with respect to some quality A.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a necessary relation by any means. It is a marginal normative relation. This is an important point even if it is a bit complex. The easy part is understanding that just because some person is good at one thing doesn't mean they are necessarily good at anything else. They might just be good at one thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more subtle point is that, while they are not necessarily good at anything else, they probably are. People who are proficient at one thing are, in reality, rarely proficient at only that one thing. Given only the information that some person is proficient at one thing, they are rationally expected to be more proficient in general than they would be if we had not been given that information. In other words, proficiency in one area is not proof of general proficiency, but it is evidence of general proficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point becomes even more powerful if the trait is randomly selected with respect to the person who's quality is in question, but it need not be randomly selected to have some importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, the Halo Effect may or may not be an example of unconscious accuracy. Unconscious accuracy could lead to the existence of true knowledge without conscious grounding. In other words, knowing that something is true without necessarily being consciously aware of why it is true or how we can know it is true. Knowing something is true without such other knowledge is often regarded as properly basic knowledge, although the reality of such knowledge is hotly debated.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowledge is often defined in epistemology as any belief which is both justified and true. The debate is on whether these qualities may be independent, or if it is required that they are all mutually interdependent. It's uncontroversial to say that knowledge exists when the qualities all exist interdependently, but it is not clear whether knowledge exist when such qualities exist independently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf A is true, A is justified, A is my belief, I believe that A is true, I believe that A is justified, I can justify that A is true, and I can justify that I believe A, then with respect to me, A interdependently believed, true, and justified. Consider that A, B, and C are all qualities, and the set of characteristics of D includes A, B, and C, as well as every possible combination of those characteristics. In this case, D is knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf A is true, justified, and I believe it, then A possesses these qualities independently, even if I do not believe that A is justified and so on. That is, I believe that A is true but not justified. Consider that A, B, and C are all qualities, and the set of characteristics of D includes A, B, and C, but it does not contain every combination of those characteristics. The debate is on whether D is still considered knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf something is true, and you believe it is true, but you don't know why you believe it is true, can you still call it knowledge? This is the question. It was previously not thought to even be worth asking because it seems so odd that anyone would think something is true when they can't explain why it should be considered true. Unconscious accuracy makes the question now worth further investigating.",

    "content": "In the past, I have written quite a bit about an <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/tag/degreed/\\\">education evaluation tool called Degreed</a>, both lauding and criticizing the service in different ways. Some of the criticisms are beginning to be addressed, although they are being addressed by the market at large, including competitors, rather than Degreed itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTest-Based Online Credentials are where it's at. <a href=\\\"http://www.skilledup.com/blog/prove-your-skills-test-based-online-credentials/\\\">This article from SkilledUp is a great introduction</a>. A company called Smarterer seems to be leading the space for the moment, but it's very much a wide-open game at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me run through a recent history of approaches to learning:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Most people went to high school. Fancier people went to vocational training and only real fancy people went to college. (&lt; 1960s)</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Then, everyone went to college. (1990s +)</li>\\r\\n\t<li>College degrees began to be complemented by certifications and so forth. (1980s - 2000s)</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Degrees and certifications began to go online. Smaller firms, not just large universities, began to produce alternative forms of education which were increasingly accepted. Badges were introduced. This is where mainstream culture is today. Resumes look like garbage dumps and it's hard to sort out strong from questionable credentials. (2000s - today).</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Degreed sorts the garbage dump and churns out education scores, a subgroup of human capital measurements. Education scores exist both for general education and specific topics. Unfortunately, these scores are hard to understand, not very accurate once properly understood, and not widely used or valued.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>In the future credentials will have at least three important qualities, and the process has already begun through Smarterer:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>The issuing bodies will have a known reputation of quality. Employers will be able to accurately, and eventually quantitatively, anticipate the productivity of a potential hire just by knowing their competency scores.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Scores will be more accurate. For example, they might measure skill quality on a scale of 1 to 100 instead of pass or fail.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Scores will be both qualitative and quantitative. For example, a score might say, \\\"Jimmy got a 64/100 in programming and one way to improve his score would be for him to practice writing Javascript scripts for websites,\\\" as opposed to, \\\"Programming: 64/100.\\\"</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Scores will be created for more than education. Health scores, grit scores, friendliness scores, and more.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Scores will allow effective comparative evaluation of competitors. Importantly, information on the distribution of scores will be made known. We will be able to compare an individual to another individual, to the average score, to the median score, to the top and bottom scores, with knowledge of the standard deviation and distribution shape.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nAs the market for Test-Based Online Credentials matures, and I think we can generalize this development model across technologies to some degree, we might expect certain things to occur:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>The market will become more distributed. It will begin with a small group of innovate firms or individuals, perhaps even a singular entity. Competitors, producing substitutes of varying degrees, will increase. Eventually, individuals or automated systems will be able to perform the entire service.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The market will become inter-compatible. At first, competitors will attempt to niche, creating a fractured market. Later, and we see this happening now, two forces will drive market inter-compatibility. The first force is a secondary market for translators and aggregators. This is where Degreed fits into the alternative education market. The second force is the consumers themselves. Consumers will demand inter-compatibility for at least two reasons. First, this promotes the credibility of a test score received from any of these institutions. Secondly, this reduces transfer costs for the case in which a consumer wants to leave one company and transact with their competitor. Suppliers will be slower to grant decreased transfer costs, but it will eventually achieved. In the longest run, individuals will be able to freely exchange this information accurately and without the need of any sort of intermediary.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>We already see the longest run developments occurring to some degree at the forefront of certain advanced information industries. In programming, for example, an need not have any credential or even work experience to be seriously considered for very lucrative employment. Instead of providing indicators of skill, the individual can directly evidence skill. This can only be done when the potential employer is equipped to understand the demonstration. This often takes the form of a portfolio of work.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>We also see the same thing happening in very old industries. Artists can utilize direct</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The market will develop superior products. Perhaps the format of the tests will change, or perhaps a solution altogether different from testing will be developed. Certainly the tests will grow to cover more topics, they will become available for reduced prices, and they will be refined to produce better indication of skill, including elimination of systematic bias in the tests. They will also eventually develop into ways which are unanticipated at the moment.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The gains from this market will externalize to improve other markets and, eventually, arbitrarily macroscopic economies. Refining these tests to improve the information they convey may involve eliminating systematic bias which can be traced into the subject matter being taught itself. This can lead not only to improve the testing of the thought type, but to improve the thought type itself. Imagine that understanding how a particular book is written can lead to an understanding of why the book itself could have been written better in certain ways. Quality testing in a variety of subjects will lead to better development of the subjects themselves. This will translate to efficiency of production and information in every market which is tested.</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

    "title": "Intro to Rails Deployment",
    "date": "2014-10-24",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article is targeted towards non-programmers and very junior programmers. It will quickly walk through some of the reasons you might want to deploy a rails-based website or web application and how to take some of those steps, along with various resources for learning ruby, rails, and other information which will help you deploy a rails application, with some information applying to deployment or web deployment writ large.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>Why would I learn Rails?</strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ruby_on_Rails&amp;oldid=628274045\\\">Rails is short for Ruby on Rails</a>. Ruby is a programming language, while Rails is a framework. What's the difference? Frameworks build on top of programming languages to do certain things more quickly or easily. In some cases frameworks can also introduce functionality which is not contained in the original language, but that is not the case for Rails. Ruby can do everything Rails can do and more, but it is extremely quick and easy to use Rails instead of Ruby when possible.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">So, you would want to learn Rails to do Ruby things more easily and quickly, which begs the question: Why would you want to learn Ruby? There are 3 answers imho:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Ruby is a server-side scripting language, unlike Javascript, so there are many things Ruby can do which JS and other client-side scripting languages cannot do. Perhaps most important among these functions is the ability to interact with a database on the server to perform CRUD operations: Create, read, update, and destroy. <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5610333/how-to-query-database-using-javascript\\\">Read more here</a>.</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Among server-side languages, Rails is particularly quick and easy to write. A competitor would include PHP, which is another server-side scripting language. PHP can do pretty much everything that Ruby or even Rails can do, and programs written in PHP generally perform slightly more quickly, but it is harder and takes longer to develop programs in PHP.</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Other people use Ruby or Rails. Learning Ruby and/or Rails can get you a job, <a href=\\\"http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Ruby_on_Rails/Salary\\\">a very high paying job these days in fact</a>, it can allow you to understand how someone's code works, and it can allow you to modify programs written in those ways.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nPersonally, I learned Rails because of reason #3. There is a large program that I needed to slightly tweek. It would take me a long time to write the program in PHP, but only a short time to tweek it if I understood Rails. The tradeoff difference was so large that I actually had time to learn Rails, tweek the program, and learn a bunch of other things I'm about to talk about, and still save time compared to if I just re-wrote the thing.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>How do I Learn Rails?</strong></p>\\r\\nI recommend Codecademy, Code School, maybe a little Treehouse, Google, and Youtube, as well as the official documentation and StackExchange for help.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>Learning Rails vs Deploying a Rails App</strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">This part is really the main point this article. Learning Rails is different from learning how to deploy a Rails app. This was new to me. Previous languages I have learned include HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. All of these can be used out of the box on a local machine with the use of notepad, or easily uploaded to any hosting company and then they basically became instantly available across the web. Not the case with Ruby. Let's discuss some important concepts:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Learning a language means that you can properly tell a computer what to do, but just like non-programming languages such as English, the thing you are talking to has to understand the language as well. Computers don't speak Ruby or Rails by default. You have to install Ruby and Rails, separately, like you might install a new desktop application.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Deployment means making something available to an end user. When a website is deployed it means that someone can go to a URL and the website appears in their browser. When an app is deployed it means that people are able to use it.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Installing Rails on a machine is an important step towards deployment, but deployment involves more than just installing Rails. As far as I know, for any language you need to install on a machine, there are more steps in deployment than only installing the language.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Specific things you will need to learn about in addition to Rails in order to deploy a website or app:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Hosting.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Finding affordable hosting that performs the way you want.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Installing Rails on a host server. High-end hosting plans including specialty app deployment hosting will have facilitated installs. Mediocre hosts will make you install through remote Command Prompt and/or SSL actions. Lower-end plans, such as as shared server hosting through GoDaddy, simply won't allow Rails installs or Command Line actions.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.heroku.com/pricing\\\">Heroku</a> is an example of an app deployment specialty hosting service. <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4536326/heroku-free-account-limited\\\">They even have a free account for minimal performance</a>, but it won't allow you to do much before you hit a performance wall. For high-end plans you should be ready to pay through the nose.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>If you need help deploying via Command Prompt and/or SSL, these resources are a good starting point:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://blowmage.com/2005/05/28/installing-ruby\\\">Installing Ruby on Shared Hosting</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://robmclarty.com/blog/how-to-setup-a-production-server-for-rails-4\\\">How to Setup a Production Server for Rails 4</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td5bDIdorMU\\\">How to Access SSH Command Line in Windows </a></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Getting the files you need on the server onto the server. Start with a CMS like Wordpress then learn FTP with Filezilla or similar.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Navigating a host back-end with CPanel or similar.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Bonus: Buy a dedicated hosting server and learn how to run it yourself, without the need for a hosting company.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Bonus: Learn PHP, MySQL, and JQuery too.Domain names and zone files.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nLearning all of the stuff I mentioned, without the bonuses, will probably take you about a year. I would recommend learning in this progression:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Month 0: Learn basic wordpress on a Wordpress.com site.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Month 3: Get a low-tier hosting account at GoDaddy. Learn about hosting, domain names, and the Wordpress CMS. The Wordpress CMS is more advanced when you have it on a hosting account compared to a Wordpress.com site, but they have many similarities as well so you will feel comfortable.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Month 4: As you continue to learn Wordpress, begin learning about HTML, CSS, and Javascript from Codecademy. Try using Filezilla this month a couple times as well.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Month 6: You should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Wordpress. At this point you can jump into learning Ruby then Rails, or you can learn PHP, MySQL, or JQuery at this time. Learning the latter skills is a great idea, but assume it will take a couple extra months to do so.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Month 8-10: Now you understand all of the basic languages you need to know, but you may not understand deployment very well or at all. Learn about deployment options and their costs. If you have the money, go for a facilitated deployment. If you don't, get ready to spend some time learning to deploy the hard way. During this time you should also make one or two small programs or scripts on your local machine to make sure you have a real understanding of building a unified program and you aren't just a Wordpress hacker.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Month 12-14: You should be able to deploy a working app. It may be a stupid, useless app, but it should be deployed and accessable.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Month 14+: Start building stuff that's more serious. Continue to educate yourself. Engage the community and get involved in open source projects. Build a portfolio. Maybe get a job or something.</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

The effect is a trade of money for sovereignty.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>This process is expected to occur in the long run for political arrangements similar to the U.S.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nExample - taken from an exercise in class with the great Prof. Sita Slavov:\\r\\n\\r\\nStacy has a federal marginal tax rate of 39.6%. Joe has a federal marginal tax rate of 15%. The market interest rate is 15%.\\r\\n\\r\\nStacy's after-tax interest rate on taxed bonds: 9.06% = 15% - (39.6% * 15%)\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe's after-tax interest rate on taxed bonds: 12.75% = 15% - (15% * 15%)\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy 1: Municipal bonds are federally taxed. Municipalities pay the market rate (15%): $30 interest paid by local government, $8.19 in revenue for federal government.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy 2: Municipal bonds are not taxed. Municipalities pay a flat rate which maximizes bonds sold (12.75%): $25.50 interest paid by local government, $0 revenue by federal government.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy change effect (P1 - P2): Local government gains $4.50, but federal government loses $8.19.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an incentive not to change policies in the amount of $3.69.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy 3: Municipal bonds are not taxed. Municipalities price-discriminate: Local government pays $21.81, $0 revenue by federal government.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy change effect (P1 - P3): Local government gains $8.19, but federal government loses $8.19. The municipal government has a motive to chose this method, but the federal government does not. On net, there is no motive to move to this policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne problem not revealed in these exercises is the practical problem of price discrimination. The federal government exercises price discrimination more than local governments do. It is unclear whether this is a problem of industry practice, legal restriction, or actual ability.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the federal government price discriminates while local governments do not, it is cheaper for local governments to receive block grants than to sell bonds of their own. This creates an incentive for local governments to accept block grants. One problem is that these come with political strings. In effect, local governments grant federal governments increased legal and political power in exchange for money.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the long run we expect the efficient result to occur. The two possible efficient results are:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Municipalities begin price-discriminating, if possible.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>If for some reason it is not possible for municipalities to price-discriminate, or if they become captured to federal incentive lock-in, then they will prefer block grants from the federal government to the provision of tax free bonds.</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

    "title": "Immigration Issues Continue",
    "date": "2014-12-07",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "As the U.S. continues to deal with immigration issues, this article summarizes some recent points.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>Not All Immigration is the Same</strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">The difference between legal and illegal immigration is an important one, as is the difference between low and high skill immigration. Illegal immigration involves individuals who have a higher propensity to engage in illegal activity including crime.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Illegal immigrants can also put a drain on government finance as they can take more in benefits than they pay in. Illegal immigrants also create an equity issue, in other words a fairness issue, because they are getting in even before those immigrants who have chosen to do things legally. They are like the kids in a school cafeteria who jump to the front of the lunch line. In short, illegal immigration can be a net loss for the economy, and it should also be a problem with anyone concerned about fairness - oddly, liberals don't seemed to concerned in this case.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Low skill immigration, even if legal, concerns some people because it can displace American workers. While I agree that this is factually the case, I don't agree it means low skill immigration is bad. While I am usually sympathetic to the idea of American Exceptionalism, it is that very idea which says that people should be judged on their merit alone. If you are displaced by an immigrant in a free market it is because they won the competition fair and square. Moreover, the competition fosters economic efficiency which can end up creating jobs and lowering prices, so it's no where near a 1-for-1 loss. In fact, even low skill workers are a large net benefit to the overall economy, in particular when they are paying taxes.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Now we get to high skill immigration. High-skill industries have virtually no unemployment. Demand is so high for this labor that American jobs are not displaced. These immigrants can sometimes cause slowed wage growth rates for American worker, but this comes no where close to a justification for wanting to restrict their inflow to the United States. Growing an economy is not about maximizing wages. If it was then minimum wages would be a great idea.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">These skills provide much needed services which are worth huge amounts of money and would otherwise be very difficult to generate at all. As a result, they represent enormous net benefits to the economy. Even if you are an American in an industry where your wage is most directly affected, you may still be better off due to increased firm viability leading to job security and growth, reduced prices, or even reduced workload. When there is such an immense shortage of labor it sometimes results in firms making current workers take on more work than they would actually like. Even if they are paid more as a result, that doesn't make it efficient or good.</p>\\r\\nIn conclusion, we need to encourage H1B Visas and also consider how we might foster legal immigration while reducing illegal immigration. One option would be to reduce legal immigration weight times.<strong>Building a Fence</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIpYYTxzZ3U\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing we could do to suppress illegal immigration would be to build a border fence. I have heard the idea often, but the video above was the first place I saw actual price data. As James Lankford points out, however, building a fence might involve ceding part of the border of Mexico to Mexico due to difficulty building inside a stream. As Ron Paul points out, this fence might be used to keep people in rather than out down the road.",

    "content": "David Friedman recently released his third edition of Machinery of Freedom, a book which advocates for Anarcho-Capitalism from a unique, Friedmanian, pragmatic, utilitarian, and empirical, rather than a priori or deductive, perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bought it and I recommend you do the same. <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Machinery-Freedom-Guide-Radical-Capitalism-ebook/dp/B00LNDWWMW/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422576440&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=machinery+of+freedom\\\">The Kindle version is available here for $3</a>. The hard copy is soon to be released. I haven't read it yet, although I have read a portion of the first edition which is available free for anyone to read here on his website. At any rate, this is not a book review.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/2tzpg5/conversation_with_david_friedman/\\\">David did an AMA on 1/28/15, ostensibly in part to boost interest in the new release</a>. It was my pleasure to ask 16 questions, 9 of which were ultimately answered, including questions I did not expect him to answer for reasons of controversy or other reasons. This article will simply show my questions with the answers, and I will also include questions from other people which I thought were either interesting or the response from David to the question was.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>My Questions</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What area of economics needs study right now?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"Three different answers:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Coase has argued that we need to develop a version of economics that takes transaction costs, institutional design, contract design, and a lot of related stuff more seriously. One can view his two famous articles as a reductio ad absurdum of the current state of economics, since it implicitly assumes away transaction costs.</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What I referred to in a blog post as the extensive margin—applying economics to things it hasn't been applied to before. Becker was an old example, Peter Leeson a more current one.</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">I think someone should apply behavioral economics to macro, that being where I suspect it would be most relevant.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">I am enrolling in a phd Fall 2015, what should I write a thesis on?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Something that interests you. I have a few ideas for research projects on my page. <a href=\\\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Miscellaneous/ideas_for_research_project.htm\\\">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Miscellaneous/ideas_for_research_project.htm</a></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What is Patri up to and have the grandkids expressed interest in economics?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"Neither of my other two children is likely to pursue economics, although both find it interesting. No idea what Tovar and Izzie will end up doing.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Who is your favorite economist still alive and contributing to the field?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"I don't have a favorite. I like Bryan Caplan. Peter Leeson has done a bunch of fun things.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">As a physicist and economist, have you looked into econophysics and what do you think?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"I have not.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Is seasteading currently the best way to get to a market oriented polical economy and/or what are some other good approaches?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"Seasteading is a neat idea. My guess is that it won't work, but it could do a lot of good if it did. Online commerce protected by encryption is another. Free cities in poor countries another.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Do you think it would be good or bad to allow selling votes?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"There's an interesting old idea that carries it further--make citizenship marketable. Including the vote.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What are your thoughts on jury nullification?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"I like to say that some ideas are both true and dangerous, and this sentence is an example. So is jury nullification. It seems obvious that one ought not to vote to punish someone for doing something that you don't think should be illegal, and if I was on a jury I don't expect I would. But if everyone believes that, there are some pretty unattractive possible consequences. You murder someone for arguing for views you strongly disapprove of and rely on at least one person on your side of the controversy on the jury to get you off.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Who, if anyone, are you pulling for in the 2016 Pres. election?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"At this point, probably Rand Paul among the major party candidates. But if the LP nominates the same candidate they did last time, I expect that if I vote I will vote for him.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Is going into academia something you would recommend to a young adult in today's world?</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What are some practical ways to help further libertarianism?</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What do you think is your father's best contribution to the field? Your mother's?</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What is your favorite change to the new Machinery of Freedom?</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Do you support attempting to unify Chicago &amp; Austrian approaches, or would this be a dirtying of the Chicago approach? If unification is potentially ideal, is there a suggested starting point?</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What are some great schools, informal organizations, and/or particular sources such as specific books from which to learn economics today, if any exist?</li>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Do you consider yourself an agnostic atheist? Have your thoughts changed regarding religion or worldview over time? If so, how?</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>Other People's Questions</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\\"We can all expect DRO's or PDA's to have varying internal structures, but how would you personally design one of your own design if you could? And your opinions on Hoppe's theoretical Aristocracy would be nice too.\\\"\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">David: \\\"I wouldn't. I believe in division of labor, and building a firm isn't something I have expertise or experience on. I'm not familiar with Hoppe's theoretical aristocracy.\\\"\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">He pretty much says Plato's theory on \\\"rule of the best\\\" is theoretically sound if they have a vested self-interest in maintaining a profitable domain over what they oversee, namely by owning it. Monarchy comes close, while being more prone to instability, but still better than democracy which leads to dictatorship more often. Whenever I look at discussion of modern Aristocracy, I think of a Corporate Board of Directors, only with a more strenuous selection process. Just looking for more opinions from the experts. EDIT: <a href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/2poqq4/how_does_hoppes_relative_arguments_for_monarchy/\\\">Discussion Link</a>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">David: \\\"I like to say that the best form of government is competitive dictatorship--the way we run restaurants and hotels. The customer has no vote on what's on the menu, an absolute vote on what restaurant he chooses to eat at. Constructing monopoly institutions in which the people making decisions really get the net benefit of those decisions is hard. One can argue that limiting voting to land owners is one approach, on the theory that the land can't move, so things that make the society on net better or worse will tend to end up capitalized in land values.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>\\\"Thanks so much for the second AMA, Dr. Friedman! I have a couple questions: I remember in the past you have described your ethical positions as similar to Huemer's, as intuitionist. Has this changed at all or do you still feel this way? Could you give a little info as to why? A link is great too. What would you say is the most convincing or valid critique of anarcho-capitalism, as you described in Machinery? What is your reply to that? I'm writing my English paper on related topics so insight would be greatly valued! Thank you so much! See you at ISFLC!\\\"\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>David: \\\"1 - I have a chapter on the subject in the third edition of Machinery. My position has not changed, although I am somewhat less confident of it, due to a critique of the argument to which I don't feel either I or Huemer has an entirely adequate rebuttal. 2 - The most convincing critique is probably the nonexistence of modern A-C societies, which suggests that they may be unstable under current circumstances. A second possible critique, having to do with the economies of scale problem, I discuss in the third edition, coming out of Buchanan's review of Machinery back when it was first published.\\\"\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>\\\"Can you expound on that critique against intuitionism? As to Huemer, have you read his Problem With Political Authority and if so, did you find it compelling?\\\"\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>David: \\\"The critique is moral nihilism plus evolutionary psychology. The evidence for intuitionism is the large degree of overlap among different people's moral intuition, rather like the large overlap between their perceptions of the physical world. The critique is that the overlap can be explained as due to selective pressure in the environment we evolved in--those are the moral beliefs that led to reproductive success. 1- I read and liked the first half of Huemer's book, haven't got around to reading the second half.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>\\\"If you could remove the government overnight with the push of a button (all the government bureaucracies and employees all gone), would you? I ask because Rothbard was an abolitionist and wouldn't hesitate to push that button. But would you as a utilitarian?\\\"\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>David: \\\"No. It takes time to develop alternative institutions. And I'm not a utilitarian. Take a look at the index entry in the second edition of Machinery for \\\"utilitarian.\\\"\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

    "title": "True Demand",
    "date": "2015-02-18",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Demand is a key consideration in economics. Demand is important at the aggregate level, but recent literature has focused on the need for better microfoundations. This article will add to the understanding of microeconomic demand by developing the concept called true demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn economics demand can either refer to aggregate or market demand, or it can refer to an individual's demand, which is the microfoundation of the former. An individual's demand is inferred from, in fact it is defined as, the individual's <a href=\\\"https://www.boundless.com/economics/textbooks/boundless-economics-textbook/economic-surplus-4/consumer-surplus-50/willingness-to-pay-and-the-demand-curve-191-12289/\\\">willingness to pay</a>. This idea of demand can be improved in at least two ways. One way it can be improved is through the removal of the financial paradigm. Another way it can be improved is through the separation of potential and actual willingness to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe financial paradigm in economics is less exercised every day, except when it's not. Economics can be used as a general sociological and noncognizant systems approach. Money is not involved in most transactions. Social transactions, for example, can be measured through economic analysis using dollar equivalents, but this translation into a dollar equivalent comes with certain problems:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Practically, translating to and from dollar value information can be problematic.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The financial paradigm is unnecessary, so why do it?</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Application or theory involving the financial paradigm often leads to situations which don't make clear sense.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nTrue demand is the solution. The concept of true demand refers to an individual's willingness to expend effort toward some goal. There are three key differences between demand and true demand:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>One might object that true demand amounts to unconstrained demand, which is infinite. I would respond that unconstrained demand is infinite only by assumption, and it is an assumption proved false time after time. I propose that unconstrained demand amounts to infinite demand for good. Not some or all economic goods, but whatever action agent perceives as morally good. A verb rather than a noun.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>True demand ignores ability. Two agents may have different actual demand but equal true demand. This can occur due to ability, or the heterogeneous stock of capitals including financial, social, human, and other capitals. Summarily, actual demand is a function of true demand and ability. Put another way, observed willingness to act is a function of willingness to act and effectiveness.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Notice that I defined demand here as willingness to act rather than willingness to pay. This is because true demand allows us to generalize outside of financial analysis. This is the next point. True demand is an explains all sorts of action. True demand explains transactions, single-agent actions, behaviors, thoughts, and choices, whether the agent is intelligent or not. Consider the click through rate of an email, for example. <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/other/intro-email-fundraising-optimization/\\\">Experimental evidence demonstrates that economic analysis of behavior applies to click rate optimization</a>. Yet there is no financial consideration involved in the entire process. This is because the thing being called and treated as 'demand' is in fact true demand. It is a measure of willingness to act, combined with effectiveness, where effectiveness is treated as constant across the population exhibiting the demand.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>True demand may be measured in abnormal units, or inferred in regular units, but it's not clear that it can be directly measured. Abnormal units are units in arbitrary scales, such as utils.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nPotential willingness to pay is essentially the willingness of an actor to pay in an unconstrained environment. As I previously mentioned, <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_curve\\\">in contrast to standard neoclassical assumptions</a>, real actors do not exhibit non-satiation. With this consideration is becomes useful to talk about their potential willingness to pay. The thing which precludes that potential is called effectiveness, and it can move between 0 and 1. If effectiveness is 1 then the agent is making the optimal unconstrained choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe separation of effectiveness and unconstrained demand is useful because it helps explain why demand is occurring at some level. Is it a matter of technical power or of social preference? Are there no apples because we cannot produce apples or because we simply don't want to even though we can? These questions are traditionally hard, but they can become easy under a new framework.",

    "title": "The Risk Paradox",
    "date": "2015-03-03",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "In economics, the theory goes, actors can be risk loving, risk neutral, or risk averse. Most people, the theory continues, are risk averse. Insurance institutions are risk neutral and rarely you will encounter perhaps a gambling addict or some such individual who is actually risk loving.\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk loving actors introduce a paradox which is not often discussed. Consider a proposition which includes some level of risk, even if the level of risk is small. The risk averse actor obtains a level of utility which is less than the risk-absent level of utility. The risk neutral actor obtains a level of utility which is equal to the risk-absent level of utility. The risk-loving actor, however, gains more utility than that actor would gain in the risk-absent but otherwise equivalent transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, consider the alternative where there is no risk. In this case the risk averse, risk neutral, and risk loving individuals all have an equal level of utility. Because real transactions are a mix of risky and non-risky transactions, the risk-loving actor is expected to maximize overall utility. The gain is even more pronounced when one considers that real world transactions are a very uneven mix, with the majority of transactions being uncertain or risky.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, risk-loving actors are also subject to rational robbery. A great example of rational robbery would be a gambling game, but there are other examples as well. In the gambling game I propose the following: let us flip a coin. If it lands on heads you give me a dollar and if it lands on tails then I will give you a dollar. This is a fair game and a risk neutral actor would play, but gain no net utility. The risk neutral actor would be indifferent. The risk loving actor would both play and also gain a utility premium, which has some dollar value. If I can identify the value of this premium held by the risk lover then I can rationally rob him with an unfair version of the game, regardless of my own level of risk preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's say the risk-lover values the fair dollar game at a rate of $.10 per game because the risk is enjoyable to that actor. Now I could invite the risk lover to play an unfair coin game in which a heads means he pays me $1.05 and tails means I pay him $1. Notice that his expected loss is less than his utility from the game, which makes the game rational from his perspective. Yet it won't be long before the guy is broke, and it takes money for him to engage in the game or otherwise to obtain utility.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we have reached the crux of the risk-lover's paradox. In one sense it utility maximizing to be a risk lover and in another way it is not. So what's the solution? The solution is that being risk neutral is efficient and preferable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that risk neutrality is efficient because it is the long run market outcome. In the short run risk aversion and risk loving may be viable options, but in the long run neither of them are. Risk loving in the long run is not viable due to rational robbery and risk aversion is not viable because it will always result in an insurance profit opportunity. Insurance transactions will occur until market risk neutrality has been reached.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that risk neutrality is not only efficient, but also preferable or moral, due to <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/theoretical-development-and-application/societal-evolution-from-a-free-market-perspective/\\\">the moral argument I call nature as a worldview filter</a>, which is essentially an argument for the morality of efficiency per se and generally. Consider that risk lovers are more likely to get killed through risky actions, and also that economic flourishing will lead risk neutral actors to overtake the population through a gradual out-competing of others in a sort of evolution process.",

    "title": "Ordinal Modelling Applied to Connoisseurship",
    "date": "2015-03-19",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Suppose the smartest guy in the world and disagrees with everyone else.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>Question:</strong></p>\\r\\nAccording to the <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/other/priori-probability-larger-values/\\\">ordinal model of a priori statistical reasoning</a>, what is the minimum number of people that would have to exist in the world in order to render his opinion statistically invalid?\\r\\n\\r\\nAssume that a statistically invalid opinion is defined as one which has a less than or equal to 50% chance of being true. Assume that you possess ordinal intelligence information for each person, but no reliable cardinal information.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\\r\\nIf two people held mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive views without ordinal weighting we would assign them each a 50% chance of being correct. If two people hold mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive views with ordinal weighting, then we assign the higher weighted person's belief a probability of 67% and the alternative a 33% probability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can be deduced either by solving: (A + B = 1 &amp;&amp; .5A = B) || (A + B = 1 &amp;&amp; A = 2B)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are either estimating that the smarter guy is twice as likely to be correct, or that the alternative is half as likely to be correct. It seems a small distinction here, but as the number of observations grow it will affect our function.\\r\\n\\r\\nI prefer to use the diminishing function because it allows us to solve complex questions without introducing infinite. It also makes it obvious that the limit of the value of each claim is 0.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, this implies that the marginal value of information is 0 in a competitive market, but very large in a market with few players. This is consistent with market assumptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf two people disagree with the genius then the probabilities would be 57.2%, 28.6%, and 14.3%, respectively.One solution is: (A + B + C = 1 &amp;&amp; .5A = B &amp;&amp; .5B = C) =&gt; 7C = 1 =&gt; C ≈ 14.3.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's say the number of observations is N and we will define the \\\"final-claim probability\\\" as the probability of the least likely outcome. In the case above, N = 3 and the final-claim probability is (1/7), or ≈ 14.3%.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice that the final-claim probability of N is the number 1 divided by the sum of pascal's triangle up until the Nth row. A quick and general way to express this sum is as Σ(2^i) for each i from i = 0 to i = N-1.Now let's suppose that we have 4 total claims. 1 + (1 + 1) + (1 + 2 + 1) + (1 + 3 + 3 + 1) = 15. The final-claim probability is (1/15), or ≈ 6.7%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first-claim probability, which is the probability that the genius is right in our example, can be solved for in two different ways:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Double the final-claim probability to get the next most likely claim probability, then double that one, and so on, until we reach the first-claim probability. In general, this is described as (P(first-claim) * 2^(N-1)).</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Take the sum of the numbers in the last row of pascal's triangle for N and multiply that by the final-claim probability. In this case that would be (1/15)*(1 + 3 + 3 + 1).</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nUsing either method, the result in this case would be that the first-claim probability is ≈ 53.3%.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith 5 total claims, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31. P(final claim) = 1/31. P(first claim) = 16/31.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway the limit of the first claim probability as N increases is 50%. You could throw significance levels in and get a smaller number, but technically the population would need to be infinite to question the genius' idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this a problem for application of the model in the real world? I would make 5 quick points:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Prima facie this seems to make the model less appealing in application to the real world. In the real world, if everyone in a market disagrees with someone then that person is probably wrong. I would like to see a model adaptation in which P(first claim) approaches 0 as N increases.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>However, our question assumes that we know this person is the smartest person. In the real world the market usually doesn't disagree with the smartest person. Given this information, perhaps the result is good and appropriate that we should be indifferent between the genius and the aggregate of all other people as the total number of people increases. It could be the case that the genius is smarter than the whole aggregation of them!

    "title": "10 Elements of an Advanced Campaign Plan",
    "date": "2015-03-24",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Writing a basic campaign plan is easy. Writing an advanced campaign plan is hard. A basic campaign plan can take as little as ten or twenty pages, while a premium plan for a large race can easily take fifty pages and sometimes even twice that much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason that premium plans can be much larger is because of the number of things which set apart a basic plan from an advanced plan. With some things in life there are only a small number of elements which separate the mediocre from the premium. In football the difference between a high school player and a professional athlete might be hard work and genetics. These things are not simple to implement, but they are few to list.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to political campaigns, the various elements which separate a basic plan from an advanced plan are neither simple to implement nor few to list. The 10 elements of an advanced plan include:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Consistent with accepted general theory and best practices</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Customized to the specific campaign context</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Actionable</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Concise and understandable</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Establishes buy-in from and inspires all coordinated parties</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Robust and agile</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Proactive and dynamic</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Self-optimizing</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Measurably effective</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Realistic</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Consistent with Accepted General Theory and Best Practices</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are certain principals that have been proven through research in political science and through repeated implementation in the field. One example of such information is found in the contents of the book \\\"Get Out the Vote\\\" by Green and Gerber. This book is based on a combination of real political campaign observation and rigorous theoretical research.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book notes a general pattern in which turnout is improved through social interaction. On page 137 of the second edition, the book states, \\\"Mobilizing voters is not merely a matter of reminding them Election Day is near. Prerecorded messages reminding people to vote do little...Mobilizing voters is rather like inviting them to a social occasion. Personal invitations convey the most warmth and work best. Next best are phone calls in which the caller converses with the respondent, as opposed to reading a canned script.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen and Gerber actually estimate specific comparative effectiveness rates in the book. Gerber notes that robocalls are less effective than in-person meetings with the candidate, but robocalls are also much cheaper than in-person meetings with the candidate. Rates of effectiveness should be multiplied by costs for execution to come up with an estimated cost per acquisition, which would be a turned out vote in this case. Cost per acquisition will directly inform the recommended spending mix.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also the place to lean on professional experience. Data from an objective survey is superior to the professional opinion of a consultant, but data from an objective survey is not always available. Professional opinion may be imperfect, but it is immensely valuable because it is holistic and may fill in the gaps where other data is not available. Moreover, professionals can help with the research process itself, improving outcomes and lowering costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Customized to the Specific Campaign Context</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe element of specific information may seem to contradict the element of general information, but in fact there is no conflict. Instead, specific information is like a house which stands on top of the foundation of general information. The two should always be consistent with one another, but the specific information takes precedent and is more useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider again the trade-off between robocalling and live calling. If there is some average price for robocalls and live calls around the U.S. then there will be a generally preferred approach which reflects those prices. However, your particular campaign may pay more or less than the average price. This means your preferences and mixes both can and should deviate from the norm accordingly to maximize efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same is true with issue advocacy. You may be a Republican, but if you are running in a moderate area the preferences of your particular constituency are not likely to reflect the preferences of the average Republican constituency. It is certainly advisable to weight the views of your particular constituency relatively highly as you form a message plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Actionable</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis third element is also the last element of any basic plan. An advanced plan must first include everything included in a basic plan and then add the icing. Many campaign plans overemphasize the theory and strategy at the expense of identifying the specific steps which need to be taken to implement that strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA message strategy may identify the economy as the primary issue for message advocacy, but that information alone is not actionable. An actionable plan contains specific tasks, budgets, and timelines.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn actionable plan, for example, would specify that the messaging on the economy will be spread through a direct mail purchase which will be delivered on May 5, an email campaign which will involve weekly emails beginning June 1, and a GOTV television ad which will hit the week before the election.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these plans would be further specified with the amounts they will cost, the times at which they must be paid, and the specific vendors which will be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Concise and Understandable</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are campaigns with 75 page campaign plans and there are campaigns which should have 75 page campaign plans, but they are not always the same campaigns. A good plan is one which will be understood by all who read it. Part of the cognitive limitation in people is that it is hard to fully take in a very large plan, and it is particularly difficult to suffer reading through an excessive plan when most of the content is plainly irrelevant.\\r\\n\\r\\nA basic plan will thoroughly describe the execution of a campaign. A premium plan will thoroughly describe the execution of a campaign in a way that is understandable to anyone who reads it and uses minimum space.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne technique to ensure that everyone understands the plan is to meet with the people who have read the plan and go over it. The plan is likely to require some explanation and some revision. The revisions may occur in the form of a whole new plan, but it is often the practice that revisions will be outlined in separate memos instead because this is convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Established Buy-In from and Inspires All Coordinated Parties</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor campaign will either not have a plan or not stick to the plan it has. A mediocre campaign will have a decent plan and roughly abide by it. A great campaign plan is not complied with because all the actors must comply, but is enthusiastically complied with because all of the actors genuinely like the plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA premium plan is created in a way that takes responsibility for incentivizing, not just instructing, the various actors properly. This incentive is achieved in at least three or four ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the campaign plan must give a plausible and convincing argument that proper execution of the plan will result in the objectives desired by all parties. Usually this is a campaign win, but sometimes it is something more or something else. Perhaps winning is not enough. Perhaps the candidate wants to win by a large margin to prove a point, or they want to garner support on some issue while they campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, buy-in is established by obtaining input from the coordinated parties prior to the creation of the campaign plan. The campaign plan is usually but not always authored by the general consultant or the campaign manager. Usually the fundraiser is better at fundraising than the general consultant. Rather than instructing the fundraiser on what he ought to do, the general consultant might ask the fundraiser what the fundraiser plans on doing. Likewise, the general consultant should ask the candidate about what they want to do. These thoughts should be integrated into the plan in order to create support for the plan because people support their own ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirdly, contracts can and should be structured in a way that creates an interest in winning through the use of financial or in kind win bonuses. This may not result in the enthusiasm which really takes the campaign up a notch, but it can at least guarantee that everyone is genuinely interested in achieving the objective.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth way to create buy in is optional because it does not always work. Depending on the personality of the candidate and other actors, it may or may not be effective for the plan to contain a section appealing to the broad values and ideology of the candidate and the campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section is visionary in nature. It steps back from the particular campaign and places the campaign in the context of a larger and more meaningful movement, which serves to inflate the perceived costs of loss and benefits of winning the particular campaign in the eyes of certain kinds of people.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther plans will intentionally steer away from such lofty talk because it may be seen as a sign of wasteful and distracted practices.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Robust and Agile</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery plan is a good plan until reality sets in. We are constantly bombarded by unanticipated changes. The best sorts of plans are resilient in the face of such changes. There are two approaches to achieving resilience, and they can work in combination as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider that your messaging strategy has identified economic issue advocacy as central to your campaign. Unexpectedly, a national political event occurs which renders your view on the economy disadvantageous for discussion. There are three potential responses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first potential response is to go on without changing your messaging. This will result in favorability loss. The next option is to stop talking about the issue and talk about something else. The final option is to continue talking about the economy with appropriately altered messaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let's say you had the good fortune to know about this change in advance. In the real world you would be planning for the possibility of such an event, rather than pretending to actually know that the event was going to occur. You could prevent your candidate from discussing the issue to begin with. This would be a robust approach, because your message strategy is not sensitive to the change in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could also instruct your candidate to discuss the issue, but prepare altered messaging in advance as a contingency plan. This would be an agile approach, because the change in question does affect your actions, but the effect is anticipated and dealt with accordingly. In the real world agility and strategic insensitivity should both be used at different times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way you can tell which path is most appropriate is derived from estimating the likelihood of the anticipated event, the estimated loss of negative outcome in the case of an agile plan, and the opportunity cost of choosing insensitivity over agility. Sometimes it turns out to be a wash between the two.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Proactive and Dynamic</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nA proactive plan is one which doesn't wait for the event to occur, and a dynamic plan is one which recognizes that actions should be altered over time. This is similar to but different from the concepts of robustness and agility because those concepts deal largely with unanticipated change, while dynamic change is focused on predictable changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an event is unlikely it may be best to treat it after the fact, but when an event is likely it should often be treated before the fact. An event common to most campaigns which may be anticipated is a bout of earned media at the time of announcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simple concept here is that the campaign can reach out and better equip the media to write the stories they are going to write in a favorable way. The campaign might send out a media packet to a list of media contacts just before the announcement which contains talking points of the campaign, or better yet the campaign might organize a full launch event with exclusive or non-exclusive media invitations.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dynamic plan will recognize that a budget should be weighted more heavily during GOTV times than other times. A dynamic campaign may begin without a campaign headquarters or staff and add those items at strategic times when funds are available. A dynamic plan recognizes that money comes over time, not all at once, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Self-Optimizing</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nPlans change. We have discussed that campaigns may plan the way in which they react to unanticipated and anticipated changes, but a slightly different concept is that the campaign plan itself should change over time. A smart campaign will outline two elements in the original campaign plan which facilitate revision of the campaign plan later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, standard operating procedures should be outlined. It is rarely the case that the plan will be written over and over. Most often, there will be a stream of memos which will go out to the various wings of the campaign to notify them of changes. It is best to have these memos created, recorded, and delivered in a planned way. This is far superior to the usual campaign practice of disorganized email blasting from one person to another, while other parties are unpredictably looped in or out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also a good idea to coordinate these memos with regular campaign meetings. The memo may prepared in advance of the meeting to inform the meeting, or after the meeting to include the notes from the meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other element of a self-optimizing campaign plan is to plan for research which will inform down road decisions. Traditionally, changes to the campaign plan which come from research findings will be included in memos just like any other change to the plan. In a non-traditional model the campaign plan is never fully written. Instead, working campaign plans are produced regularly as research and events continue to unfold. These working campaign plans look a bit like enormous memos, but the first one looks much smaller than an ordinary plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Measurably Effective</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most accurate sign of the competency of a consultant is their willingness to bet on their own success. Likewise, one sign of a top notch campaign plan is the presence of specified and measurable expected outcomes. Many campaign plans will either state or assume without stating that a win in the campaign is also a win for the strategy, but this is not always the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nPollsters often mention the concept of a pollsters' victory. The idea here is that a candidate may have lost, but the pollster predicted the loss and so the pollster was validated as effective. Likewise, a candidate may win despite what a poll says. This transparent difference between a pollster and a campaign should apply to every vendor within the campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campaign plan should be effective enough to specify the predicted outcome. At a minimum this should estimate the predicted vote outcome. Consultants will often retrospectively explain deviation from the predicted outcome as due to any cause other than the performance of the consultant. A really top notch campaign plan will seek to minimize this scapegoat bias by predicting contingent deviation effects as well as the actual expected outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, a poor campaign plan will assume that winning validates the plan. A better plan will specify that if the plan is properly executed the consultant anticipates a certain vote turnout, whether or not that entails actually winning. The best sort of plan will go on to predict what the vote turnout will be if the plan is improperly executed. For example, if the campaign raises $10,000 under its goal, what is the expected turnout?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some cases this sort of research amounts to over-planning and resource waste, but it may also serve to prove the credibility of the consultant and campaign team. It should also be noted that retrospective analysis by consultants is a good and valuable practice for the consultant and the larger campaign despite the inherent bias involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Realistic</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a campaign plan estimates outcomes even when the campaign plan is not followed then you will be able to retrospectively tell whether or not the plan was realistic simply by the error, or lack thereof, in its prediction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs previously discussed, such research is expensive to do and rarely occurs. In practice, the outcome is often estimated assuming that the plan is followed. The question then arises, was the plan ever realistic? It is easy to say that when I raise one million dollars I will likely win my small town mayoral race, but it is unrealistic to plan on having that much money for such a small race.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimating realism before the fact is all about having quality information. Three ways to maximize the quality of information include making sure that the candidate is personally informed as possible, paying for quality data and data services as needed, and attempting to have multiple actors, including vendors and the candidate, independently duplicate conclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical campaign planning is not an exercise in omnipotence. No plan is ever perfect and errors both in planning and in the field should be expected. With the tips given we can at least ensure that the various actors are aware of and agree to the plan. It will also mean that the plan is as realistic as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guidelines presented in this article can be leveraged in content creation or in connoisseurship. If you are seeking to create an optimal plan, implement the points that have been made. If you have received a plan and would like to discern whether it is of a high caliber, learn to spot the concepts discussed. If you have something to add, leave a comment.

    "date": "2015-04-05",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article discusses the fact that Easter and Christmas as often celebrated contain pagan influence. I mention this not to invalidate Christianity, but to provide for the better practice of Christianity by eliminating bad traditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor starters, Easter, Passover, and Resurrection Day are all fundamentally and conceptually different even if they coincide on the calendar. Secondly, they don't coincide on the calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster is allegedly the name of an ancient festival. Sources either paint it as deriving from the Babylonian Ishtar or the Germanic Eostre.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epic_of_Gilgamesh&amp;oldid=654522506\\\">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a> is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia. Dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (circa 2100 BC), it is often regarded as the first great work of literature. The Epic mentions Ishtar, a Babylonian goddess.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Ishtar came to be <a href=\\\"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte\\\">called Astarte in Greek</a>. Astarte was the word to describe Ishtar as a foreign goddess, not an entity in Greek mythology, although there is speculation that Astarte <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_%28mythology%29#Abduction\\\">is related to the Greco-Roman Europa</a>.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C4%92ostre&amp;oldid=654831057#Locations.2C_personal_names.2C_and_the_matronae_Austriahenea\\\">Eostre or Ostara </a>are two different translations of the same Germanic diety, attested solely by <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede\\\">Venerable Bede</a>. Eggs and rabbits seem to be associated with Germanic tradition, although the existence of Eostre or Ostara has been harshly criticized because there is little evidence for those terms.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nI think the term Easter came into usage as a result of Bede's invention and Martin Luther's subsequent and strange usage in his translation of the Bible into German. Regardless, the important point regarding the origin of the term Easter is not that it is German, Babylonian, or an accident. The important point is that Easter has nothing to do with Christianity, Judaism, or the Bible.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover\\\">Passover</a> is the English equivalent of the Hebrew word variously transliterated as Pasch, Pesach, and others. Passover was the night the spirit of the Lord passed over Egypt and brought judgement on it by striking down the unprotected firstborns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis occurred on <a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12\\\">the night of the fourteenth day of the first month</a> in the Jewish lunar calendar. That's the month of Nisan. <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#Boundaries_of_the_day\\\">In Judaism, night begins a new day</a>. So the night of the fourteenth day is actually considered the beginning of the fifteenth day in Judaism.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportantly, Passover is considered a Sabbath day, or a holy day where there should be no work. I generally agree with the view that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe week of Jesus' crucifixion contained two Sabbath days. The Passover was on Thursday and there was also the weekly Sabbath, which occurs each Saturday. Crucifixion Day was on <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/john/19-14.htm\\\">the preparation day for Passover</a>. Read more about different views of the <a href=\\\"http://www.gotquestions.org/three-days.html\\\">timing of the crucifixion here</a>, including added information on the Wednesday view.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck out <a href=\\\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/Christmas_TheRealStory.htm\\\">this article</a> on the pagan origins of the December 25 date for Christmas, as well as the pagan origins of numerous Christmas traditions including caroling, kissing under mistletoe, Christmas trees and more. The Bible seems to <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10.htm\\\">specifically condemn the worship of Christmas trees</a>. While most Christians don't worship Christmas trees, it still might not be great practice to have them around.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the date of Jesus' birth is not certain, we do have some Biblical estimates. It is generally thought that a Biblical date for the birth of Jesus is sometime during September, and perhaps the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles in particular, for reasons outlined in the following two articles:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"https://carm.org/on-what-day-month-was-jesus-born\\\">On what day and month was Jesus born?</a></li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://biblelight.net/sukkoth.htm\\\">On What Day Was Jesus Born?</a></li>\\r\\n</ol>",

    "date": "2015-04-26",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Many anarcho-capitalist thinkers claim that <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_defense_agency\\\">private defense agencies</a> (PDAs) would exist in an anarcho-capitalist society (ACS). <a href=\\\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Law_as_a_private_good/Law_as_a_private_good.html\\\">David Friedman is one example</a>. But why do we think this? That's what this article is about.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose there are two key actors and one does something the other doesn't like. If the degree of the offense is perceived as sufficient than the offended party might attempt to coerce the other party into behaving in the desired way. They could engage in direct physical violence, indirect physical violence through third parties, direct peaceful resolution, or indirect peaceful resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe likely outcome is indirect peaceful resolution. Direct physical violence is costly for at least three reasons. There is a risk of death, the expense of purchasing weapons and training and so on, and opportunity cost. Direct physical violence is unlikely to occur because it is likely the case that each individual could pay someone else, such as a specialized military firm, to conduct violence instead. The specialized firm would be able to produce a larger quantity of force for a much smaller cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expected result is that people will contract private security firms rather than engage in personal conflict. This is reflected in the real world already. We see many more business owners that hire private security firms compared to the number of business owners that prefer to personally patrol the premises of their businesses. We also see that many people are unhappy paying taxes, but they would prefer to pay taxes than to have to personally enter a war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe security firms, however, start to notice something. People don't want to die, and bombs are not very reusable, so supplying additional labor and capital gets expensive very quickly for the security firms. It is much cheaper for opposing security firms to arrange prior agreements with one another. Should we be forced to go to war, for example, we will limit the number of troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, security firms need not send any troops or weapons at all! The entire system can just become a system of prior arranged contracts. This is now a private legal system and the security firms are also creating private law amongst themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is always the risk that the other firm or firms, as there can be multiparty situations as well, will falsely enter into an agreement. For this reason, a certain amount of force is always kept on reserve, but it is to act as an insurance policy and a deterrent for contract breaking, rather than being kept with the intention of actual use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe need to exercise force will be even further reduced by the power of reputation or social capital through a mechanism called the discipline of constant dealings. The discipline of constant dealings is an idea which states that two firms which expect to interact with each other repeatedly over time have an incentive to fulfill their agreements with each other. This is because the profit gained in the long run from successful trade is expected to exceed the profit gained in the short run from cheating or lying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discipline of constant dealings is easily expanded into a general value for reputation or social capital. Suppose two actors do not expect to deal with each other repeatedly over time. It is still the case that each actor will have an incentive to fulfill their contracts due to the effect lying has on their public reputation. If a firm gains a public reputation as a dishonest firm they will lose business.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, these security firms may specialize into separate firms, or the may not, depending on the value of the economies of scope in the production of their various services. A security firm might break into separate law producing firms, case-hearing firms, enforcement agencies, insurance agencies, security agent training firms, weapons manufacturers, prison system managers, and so on. Other firms might find it cheaper to produce several of these products in-house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I speak of 'legal firms' in ACS society, I am referring to the collection of firms responsible for law creation, adjudication, and enforcement.",

    "content": "This article notes two interesting facts on the recent Garland shootings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recently retweeted a writer named Brad Thor regarding this issue, who I thought put it pretty well. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If you look at the #garlandshooting and your first impulse is to criticize free speech, you are a HUGE part of what is wrong with America.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Interesting fact 1: The two Muslims attacked the group <a href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/05/04/404158281/5-things-to-know-about-the-organizers-of-mohammed-cartoon-contest\\\">right after SPLC labeled it a hate group.</a></strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is a far left organization that likes to paint far right organizations as near-terrorist organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the SPLC itself has now instigated two violent attacks. <a href=\\\"http://www.wnd.com/2013/04/see-terrorist-with-gun-attack-family-research-council/\\\">They also contributed to the terrorist attack on the Family Research Council</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally most of the leftist media failed to identify the two gunmen as Muslims. I suspect it would have been the primary interesting fact if the shooters had been Christian, but Christians don't engage in the violent things Muslims engage in. Just think through recent history.\\r\\n\\r\\nActually, <a href=\\\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/05/isis-posts-warning-we-have-71-trained-soldiers-in-15-states-names-5-targets/\\\">ISIS specifically claimed responsibility for the attack</a> as a planned event and went on to state that they have 71 trained soldiers in 15 U.S. states including Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, California, and Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeller has actually been conducting anti-Islam campaigns around Houston for a while now. Back when I was at school in Houston she was still doing this.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Interesting fact 2: Garland is among the nation's most desegregated areas.</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nNate Silver at the 538 blog recently released an article entitled, \\\"<a href=\\\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/\\\">The Most Diverse Cities Are Often The Most Segregated</a>.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTangentially, AFR's Bryan Fischer posted the article on Facebook, saying, \\\"The most segregated cities in America are all run by liberals.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome might look at the Garland attack and correctly identify the issue as the result of conflicting cultures and worldviews. What is the solution? Some might propose that increased diversity and integration will fix the problem. I actually tend to agree with this view, but Nate's data makes an interesting point.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway the interesting thing here is that it turns out that Garland has abnormally high levels of desegregation. Now, some cities have high desegregation because there is low diversity. If everyone is white, then there is low segregation and low diversity. Without looking at the data you might think Garland was such a case.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot so! Garland has diversity which rivals Chicago. This surprised even me. It turns out that Garland may be a prototypical case of the American melting pot idea, and that is precisely where this unfortunate event occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, Aurora, CO is also a high desegregated area with high diversity, but lower than that of Garland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, it seems that very high diversity is not necessarily the socially optimal arrangement. I also doubt that very low cultural diversity is optimal. I suspect all things should be in moderation and there is a Goldilocks level somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmack in the middle of the diversity index is Jacksonville, FL. This city has <a href=\\\"http://www.bestplaces.net/economy/city/florida/jacksonville\\\">lower than US average unemployment and higher than US average job growth, but lower than US average income</a>. Maybe there's something there, I don't know.",

    "title": "Global Financial Crises and Institutions Cheat Sheet",
    "date": "2015-05-09",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "I recently completed a class called Global Financial Crises and Institutions with Dr. Nils Bjorksten. A great class by the way. We were permitted the use of a single page so-called \\\"Cheat Sheet\\\" during the final exam. The text below was my cheat sheet. It fit on one page using the front and back with extra wide margins in size 10 Calibri font.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>Financial Crisis Cheat Sheet</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Global governance v. national government</strong>: Instead of a global legislature and court system, policymakers meet and make nonbinding statements. A network of multilateral institutions follows up with technical support work.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Bretton Woods</strong>: Governments directly controlled capital movements (that is, exchange rates). In 1960s many thought dollar overvalued. Nixon closed gold window in 1971. Flexible, more floating-based, exchange rates flourished.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Mundell’s Impossible Trinity</strong>. Cannot have independent monetary policy, stable exchange rate, and open capital markets simultaneously. <strong>Rodrick’s Political Trilemma</strong>: cannot have deep economic integration, a nation state, and democratic politics all at once. Bretton woods allowed nation states with democratic politics while ignoring deep economic integration, which is liberalized tread and capital. <strong>Dirty float</strong> is in the middle of Mundell’s impossible trinity. ie loose float like china was at one time, although at other times china hard a strict float and very recently they are arguably market priced.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Hedgehogs</strong> only have one trick but it’s a good one (liberalization). <strong>Foxes</strong> always say it depends and use complex plans. Truth in the middle: There is a usually good solution but needs to be put in context which usually makes optimal implementation relatively complex.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>LDC Debt Crisis:</strong> “less-developed-country” or Latin American Debt Crisis occurred in 1980s. In 70s several less developed countries, notably Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, borrowed large amounts. In 70s and 80s the world economy went into recession due in large part to oil prices. A liquidity problem for certain countries arose. In 1982 Mexico declared it would not be able to service its debt and lending to Latin America abruptly halted. 1980s known as La Década Perdida or the lost decade bc it took about the whole decade for the damaged economies to recover. But <strong>is a country ever really insolvent</strong>, or does it just fail in terms of willingness to pay because political election is not tenable for people who would pay (bc it would cost voters)</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>LDC crisis solutions</strong>: Initially U.S. forbearance. LDCs engaged in austerity and structural adjustments (privatization, deregulation, trade liberalization, tax reform). <strong>Baker plan</strong> had no debt forgiveness. World Bank, IADB to help with debt rescheduling and associated structural adjustment. Paris Club utilized, use of paris club requires having a program with IMF. <strong>Brady plan</strong> 1989 Negotiations for debt reduction (haircuts). A haircut marks down the value of an asset by sale or balance sheet, not forgiveness, loss relative to first price but not to current fair price. LDC made debt forgiveness look good.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Shadow banking</strong> is non-traditional banking. Traditional banking hard2define but many say: Reserve-based deposit lending. Much of Shadow Banking is securities markets including derivatives. Dodd-Frank addresses some of Shadow Banking by including securities regulation. Housing/Financial Crisis/Great Recession</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Bail out vs bail in</strong>: Bail-out means someone external to the problem inserts money, usually a government (LDC interesting case). Bail-in means creditors put in money to fix the problem (or grant forbearance, debt forgiveness, haircuts, etc). LDC was a combination bail out and bail in. In LDC the creditors left ‘holding the bag,’ but some creditors were govt’s and govt orgs (IMF).</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Central planning collapses in 1989</strong>. Now need to secure stability, estabilsh banking system w/ central bank, fix taxes, privates firms, permit new firms, cut subsidies, liberalize prices, start social safety net. Areas affected are big and close.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Problems of liberalization</strong>: Revenue problems, expenditure (subsidy) problems, hyperinflation, unemployment, social unrest, no social safety net, price instability, political instability, and reform fatigue. Crises sprung up from rapid liberalization, but many bounced back quickly (Russia, Bulgaria, Czec Republic, and Baltics). Sometimes new economic elites captured thrown out governments.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Washington Consensus</strong>: Main message: Large government approach discredited; liberalize markets, privatize where possible, let incentives drive development. Includes tax reform, competitive (float or at least fundamentally based price) exchange rate, Trade liberalization, deregulation, and more. Crises in 80s and 90s led to rethinking through 90s. Market orientation retained, but tempered by country-specific non-market interventions (notably restricting capital flows and exchange rate arrangements)</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>ERM crisis</strong> (exchange rate mechanism). Showed fixed exchange rates and free capital flows can be a dangerous combination. European integration project started with exchange rates stable (’87). Bretton Woods collapse a problem, Resolved by “snake” (pegging each other) 1972-77, replaced by ERM in 1979. Key points: July 1987: The Single European Act. Completion of the frontier-free market by end of 1992, July 1990: Phase 1 of EMU removes restrictions on capital movements. December 1991: Maastricht agreement on draft Treaty on European Union: completion of EMU and introduction of a single European currency, June 1992: Maastricht treaty fails Danish referendum vote, which sparks unwinding of convergence plays</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Treaty of the European Union 1992 (Maastricht Treaty)</strong>: Replaced EEC with European Union: Agreed on Economic and Monetary Union to proceed in three stages, 1990-93: Completely free circulation of capital, 1994-98: Countries achieve convergence criteria, 1999-2001: Introduction of common currency and European Central Bank</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>ERM unfolding</strong>: Finland first country to abandon peg, Sept ‘92, Soros bet against Bank of England and won, Successful speculative attacks on Italy, Spain, Sweden futilely set overnight rates at 500%, France successfully defended its peg, Portugal, Ireland, Spain devalued in May 1993, Currency bands widened to 15%, effectively floating all exchange rates; crisis ended</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>ERM Crisis to Washington Consensus</strong>: Questioning whether exchange rate crises can be blamed on poor fiscal and monetary discipline, Awareness that financial sector can be source of shocks, crises now believed to be bad policies and shifts in investor sentiment. <strong>Surprises</strong>: Failure to grow, public revenue problems, and price/exchange rate stability problems. eg, ERM case, the market didn’t act like policymakers thought investors are supposed to act. Speculative attacks and market emotion weren’t supposed to happen, they were supposed to use specific metrics of market fundamental health.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Crises</strong>: LDC, ERM, Mexican 94 with tequila contagion, transition, Asian 97, Dot-Com, Housing.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>How do you fix a run on a bank</strong>? Deposit insurance, lender of last resort (IMF), orderly entry and exit, regulate to prevent. How do you fix a ‘run on a country?’ or country debt issues (size matters)</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Transition crisis</strong>: (from Soviet Russia to democratic states) Much more difficult and drawn out than expected, Politics could overwhelm technocratic programs (e.g., Russia)</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Asian crisis</strong>: capital account crisis with new features: Inside of managed capitalism, healthy fundamentals and deep financial integration of private markets, but banks had close, nontransparent relationships with industrial conglomerates, Foreigners happy to invest, but only in foreign currency and only short term, little oversight led to corporate overinvestment</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Features of Capital Account Crises</strong>: Presence of large balance sheet effects, Private sector is part of the problem and the solution. Capital crises implied new role for IMF: From crisis lender to crisis manager. Arrange additional financing, encourage private sector involvement (bail in), Help negotiate debt forgiveness if necessary. Is the IMF up to the task? <strong>Problems</strong>: Technical competence, impartiality, political legitimacy, and has no role in U.S. crisis. Perceived poor performance led to- backlash against the IMF through 90s. How has IMF responded or adapted? 1999 external evaluation of what went wrong (Crow report), Establish Independent Evaluation Office (IEO), New International Capital Markets department, Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercises, Greater transparency, reweight voting power on Executive Board</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>We should have expected housing crisis</strong> according to Reinhart and Rogoff. “Periods of high international capital mobility have repeatedly produced international banking crises, not only famously, as they did in the 1990s, but historically.” R&amp;R book – debt build up is a warning sign, but debt to GDP ratio more important than level of debt, another warning sign was immense rise in housing prices, rising consumer debt, and huge leveraged positions by traders.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Financial regulation</strong> is constructed piecemeal over time, on what existed in the past. Is it sound? “In policy work you never start with a clean slate.” Unintended consequences happen. We are always in one of three crisis phases: prevention, containment, recovery</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Financial crisis</strong>: (housing, great recession) Financial sector recovered way before real economy. Recovery: interest rates, stimulus, bail out</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Paradox of policy response</strong>: “Actions that seem reasonable – letting banks fail, forcing their creditors to absorb losses, balancing government budgets, avoiding moral hazard – make the crisis worse. Actions necessary to ease the crisis seem inexplicable and unfair.” Tim Geithner</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Dodd-Frank aims to: Reduce systemic risk, End too big to fail, Shadow banking oversight, Derivatives oversight, Improve bank safety and soundness, Higher mortgage standards, Curb Fed emergency authority for bailouts, Do something about credit rating agencies, Consumer financial protection, Investor protection, Corporate governance, Federal insurance office</li>\\r\\n\t<li><strong>Expected questions</strong>: 1) Crises reshape view of Washington Consensus, 2) Can you bail out a country? 3) Is a country ever really insolvent? 4) Is hyperglobalization still the future? (Hyperglobalization means free flow like Rodrik’s deep economic integration, liberalization, Washington Consensus.) 5) Bail out vs bail in? Who actually gets bailed out? 6) Is IMF up to task of crisis manager instead of crisis lender? 7) Problems and solutions to piecemeal regulation? 8) paradox of policy response</li>\\r\\n</ul>",

    "title": "Political Signals as Modified Market Signals",
    "date": "2015-05-10",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article argues that political signals are modified market signals with generally predictable modifications that may be able to be corrected for with additional information.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkets send social signals in a way that is harder to understand but more valuable than something like a survey. Market signals are more valuable because they are based on revealed preference rather than espoused or identified preference. Market signals are also more readily convertible into quantities and numbers because this is their original form.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, market signals are more truthful, informative, precise, and useful than something like a survey because the market itself is an emergent entity which is expected to better calculate than any subgroup of individuals within the market. This is because the market calculation process involves all stakeholders and it has an objective and complex weighting system, which is the pricing and income system, which increases the voice of the people who are most likely to be correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe market speaks through price signals. Movements of price, preference, supply, and demand, do not occur in English. Political signals are a modified market signal because there is a market for policy but it is subject to special rules which are a modification or regulation of a free market. These rules include winner-take-all politics, one person one vote, the decoupling of voting from productivity, donation caps, regulation of organizational coordination, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical signals are also market signals in the sense that money and preferences ultimately drive politics. The good thing is that we can hear signals fairly clearly through the political process. For example, if Bill says he supports an pro-abortion policy and his favorability drops, there is a sociopolitical signal against that policy. The explanatory power of a politician's policy stance on his favorability amounts to quantifiable favorability of the policy itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bad thing is that the political voice, the opinions of our elected leaders, unelected judges, and so on, are known to deviate and misrepresent the voice of the underlying market.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps another good thing is that the manner of this deviation is fairly predictable in direction, but unfortunately it is not particularly predictable in magnitude. The bias of the political process is to favor itself and its own interests as all social entities tend to do. The political voice, therefore, has a bias in favor of slower liberalization, greater risk aversion, and general favor of the public sector, but it's not clear how strong this bias is.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemand for fiscal conservatives and libertarians (in the form of votes, donations, volunteering services and so on) are expected to signal demand for relatively rapid economic liberalization and vice versa, but the signal is expected to be systematically weakened by the political process.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distortion in the political signal is also an almost direct predictor of the inefficiency of political choices. The degree to which policymakers are inefficiently selected should correlate with the degree to which inefficient policies are selected, ceteris paribus.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do we minimize the distortion and consequent inefficiency in the political signal? Liberalize the political market. Raise donation caps, commoditize votes, legalize coordination, and so on. Competitive government or polycentric government and anarcho-capitalism are longer run solutions, but keeping a more economically liberal political system is an intermediate step.",

    "title": "Larken's 5 Questions",
    "date": "2015-05-16",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Larken recently created a YouTube video against Austin Peterson's <em>5 Reasons I'm Not an Anarchist</em>. Tangentially, <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/politics-and-government/austin-peterson-is-a-neocon/\\\">I recently wrote against Austin's article as well</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/Cms4B_4_WtM?t=35m55s\\\">In the last 5 seconds of the video</a>, Larken asks 5 questions <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OktoHN0FDTM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m50s\\\">which he claims</a>, once answered, will show that \\\"there is no one, no one in the world, who can give a consistent, rational, moral justification for believing in government at all.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I get to the questions, I would point out that Lark en and I are both anarchists but I think we are rather different types. I oppose government as a pragmatist on the grounds of economic efficiency and utility. Larken has a moral opposition to government. Larken not only opposes the state, but the concepts of authority and government per se. <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OktoHN0FDTM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m25s\\\">He claims</a> \\\"...the belief in authority, which includes the belief in government, is horrendously destructive, it is the primary threat to humanity...and it's time for it to change.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImportantly, the belief in authority also includes the belief in God. In contrast to Larken, I claim that some authority and government are inescapable, necessary, moral, and proper. However, this is not the case for all authority, and it is the case for certain authorities only some of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the traditional state is a form of government which is increasingly illegitimate over time as it becomes relatively more inefficient compared to alternative institutions such as the market. In fact I think it is already the case that government is entirely illegitimate on such grounds, but I think there was a period in history where it was legitimate on such grounds which has to do with certain transaction costs and organizational structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a separate forthcoming article I will ask 10 questions which should help to establish various aspects of my view on authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nApologies if anything is poorly worded. I hope we can operate on principles of intellectual charity in order to improve the social debate, not just to win technical points. That being said, I do welcome recommended refinements of language.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>Larken's 5</strong></p>\\r\\n<em>1 - Is there any means by which any number individuals can delegate to someone else the moral right to do something which none of the individuals have the moral right to do themselves?</em>\\r\\n\\r\\nYes and no. Two sorts of rights exist and both have cases where individuals may cause other individuals to come into possession of rights they would not otherwise have, but this causal relation is not a matter of delegation. These rights frameworks do, however, provide mechanisms for the emergence of unique rights for a traditional state and other entities.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe facto rights exist and divine rights exist. De facto rights exist when a person cannot be prevented from conducting some action.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the case that individuals may collectively conduct actions which none of them could conduct individually. While a person may build a widget in a week, 2 people may be able to build a widget in a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding quickly may be seen as a fundamentally different action than building slowly. A de facto license to a new action has been granted through collective action.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be the case that building 1 widget per week is immoral while building 7 widgets per week is moral.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider a scenario where 2 widgets exist and either can be built at the same rate by an individual, but Widget B can save twice the number of lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe individual can be considered to be morally required to build Widget B because the opportunity cost of the unsaved life can be viewed as something similar to murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, consider that Widget A is subject to large economies of scale which Widget B is not subject to. A team of 2 people can built 7 of Widget A in a week, or 1 of Widget B. In this case it would be moral for the collective entity to build Widget A while it would be immoral for an individual to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr, consider a simpler scenario in which the individual just can't build the widget. Perhaps he lacks diverse required skills or something. A collective may build a moral widget, or perform a moral service, which an individual cannot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can be called moral productivity and it is a case of de facto morality. Basically, economic efficiency can allow a morally productive process to increase in moral productivity, even from negative to positive values.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile collectives have a de facto right to certain actions which individuals have no right to do, it does not follow that the collective entity needs to be a traditional state.\\r\\n\\r\\nDivine rights exist when God gives either a moral license or requirement for something.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod gives unique moral license and requirements to national rulers, education instructors, and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen individuals elect a person to the office of President, for example, God may chose to give that person unique moral license and requirements. On the other hand, God may view democracy as fundamentally different from God-chosen kings, autocrats, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen individuals allow a person to work as a teacher this may also result in God, not the individual, giving additional moral requirements to the new teacher. God's moral allocation is not unique to the case of the traditional state.\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>2 - Do those who wield political power have the moral right to do things which other people do not have the moral right to do? If so, from whom and how did they acquire such a right?</em>\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, as provided for under the previous question. De facto rights from their new position of power and divine rights from God.\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>3 - Is there any process by which human beings can transform an immoral act into a moral act (without changing the act itself)?</em>\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoral productivity can allow the same act to be moral or immoral. For example, being an ineffective surgeon might be immoral because you might just be killing lots of people, but a skilled surgeon doing the same things might be moral because they save lots of lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as previously discussed under section 1, different degrees of moral productivity can be seen as fundamentally different actions. Building widgets quickly can be seen as the same or a different action compared to building widgets slowly, depending on how you define terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanctification is the process through which God makes things good. The doctrine of <a href=\\\"https://carm.org/dictionary-hypostatic-union\\\">Hypostatic Union</a> says Jesus Christ is both man and God. Jesus declared all foods clean. Jesus declared healing the sick on the sabbath moral, although it's less clear whether he actually made that act moral or simply revealed the assumed immorality of the act to be faulty from the beginning. Jesus also declared additional moral responsibilities, arguably making previously morally neutral things now morally bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the possibility that God grants moral license to democratic leaders, it's unclear whether voters are considered partially responsible for that grant. Not in the sense that the voters are the origin or even capable of granting that license, but in the sense that if they had selected someone else God would have as well, so voters may be said to have some explaining power or influence on the outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>4 - When law enforcers use force in the name of government, do they bear the same responsibility for their actions that anyone else would who did the same thing on his own?</em>\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. What do we mean by bearing responsibility? We see special treatment of military and cops all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, in the divine sense the agents of government have some privileges, but are also susceptible to greater standards of judgement. However, some of the divine rights stuff becomes unclear when dealing with the democratic model, and even less clear when dealing with the anarcho-capitalist model of private law and security.\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>5 - When there is a conflict between an individual's moral conscience and the commands of a political authority, is the individual morally obligated to do what he personally views as wrong in order to obey the law?</em>\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly in the case that the individual is wrong. If the individual correctly believes that the law is morally wrong then they have a moral license to disobey, although they may not have a practical ability to do so. On the other hand, it might be the case that the person believes a law to be immoral when it is in fact objectively moral, in which case they have no license to disobey although they may believe otherwise.",

    "content": "This article argues that criminal investigation is applied intelligent design.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a cop seeks motive or to investigate conformity to <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi\\\">modus operandi</a>, he or she is actually using concepts foundational to intelligent design. Specifically, the investigator assumes the teleological nature of intelligence and that intelligence is the source of complex specified information (CSI).\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigators also employ a foundational method underpinning both the theory of evolution and the theory of ID when building a case account. That approach being <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning\\\">abductive reasoning or inference to the best explanation</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe <a href=\\\"http://www.intelligentdesign.org/whatisid.php\\\">theory of intelligent design</a> holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause. Intelligent design involves many concepts including irreducible complexity and others, but I am a particular fan of establishing the likelihood of intelligent design through <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specified_complexity\\\">the concept of specified complexity as formulated by William Dembski</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nDembski provides the following examples to demonstrate the concept: \\\"A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A Shakespearean sonnet is both complex and specified.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA modus operandi is also specified and complex. When a detective perceives a number of events to be consistent with a modus operandi, that investigator rationally speculates there may be a common agent or set of agents at work.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common mode of operation could alternatively be explained by coincidence or structural and environmental patterns, but these explanations become increasingly unlikely as the pattern of information persists over time and increases in specified complexity. At a certain point it becomes most likely, though never certain, that there is an intelligent cause. The fact that detectives are often right provides significant empirical validity for intelligent design.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an investigator seeks to establish motive they perform a seperate application of intelligent design. They are assuming the teleological nature of intelligence. Motive is a necessary for any teleological actor by definition. Economics agrees with this assumption of motive and teleology within humans, further specifying that the motive is the maximization of utility. It could also be argued that the rational actor model and <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/other/id-is-real-science-part-2/\\\">the Austrian Action Axiom</a> both validate intelligent design.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an investigator seeks to build an account of a case or sequence of events they are using abductive reasoning. Darwin utilized abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation, to support his theory of evolution. This method is also used by ID proponents to support the theory of intelligent design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe validity of intelligent design entails some expected validity for its presupposed definition of intelligence. This is cool because there is a big debate right now over how to define intelligence and whether or not it is actually a thing.",

Therefore, I argue, it is possible and even good to be biased towards the truth, while it is impossible not to be biased. It perhaps follows that the conclusions of a person admitting to be biased should be more trusted than the conclusions of a person claiming not to be biased.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nMike Weishar is a self-identified progressive liberal, but he hits the nail on the head of this topic as well. His article <em><a href=\\\"http://quietmike.org/2014/05/19/myth-fair-and-balanced-media/\\\">The Myth of the Fair and Balanced Media</a></em> is full of excellent quotes like these:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>\\\"A fair and balanced media does not exist, nor should it\\\"</li>\\r\\n\t<li>\\\"If you look at the three main cable news networks; MSNBC, Fox and CNN, not one of them really lives up to that motto anyway.\\\"</li>\\r\\n\t<li>\\\"To suggest that the news should be fair and balanced is to suggest that there are multiple sides to every truth or fact. There isn’t, facts are facts.\\\"</li>\\r\\n\t<li>\\\"For instance, ninety percent of people in the United States support background checks for purchasing firearms. If that’s the case, isn’t it disingenuous to be interviewing one person who supports it and one person who doesn’t?\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nMike makes statements I disagree with along the way, but the fact that such different people can agree that a fair and balanced perspective is a myth helps show how basically true it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've deflated bias and shown that it is often good, but I don't intend to deflate it completely. I will quickly reaffirm that bias is in some ways a predictably bad thing. I will then conclude with a particular example of truth and bias related to a debate about intelligent design.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Murray Rothbard's lesser known feats is that he contributed to an objective study of establishing the motives of individuals. From page 9-10 of <a href=\\\"http://www.cmi-gold-silver.com/pdf/historyofmoney.pdf\\\"><em>A History of Money and Banking</em>:</a>\\r\\n<blockquote>In general, the question of “Cui bono?” - or “Who benefits?” - from changes in policies and institutions receives very little attention...new economic historians have sought to explain the ex post aggregate distribution of income that results from a given change in the institutional framework or in the policy regime. What their method precludes them from doing is identifying the ex ante purposes as well as ideas about the most efficacious means of accomplishing these purposes that motivated the specific individuals who lobbied for or initiated the change that effected a new income distribution. However, avoiding such questions leaves the quantitative data themselves ultimately unexplained. The reason is that the institutions that contribute to their formation, such as the railroads or the Fed, are always the complex resultants of the purposive actions of particular individuals or groups of individuals aimed at achieving definite goals by the use of specific means. So the new economic history is not history in the traditional sense of an attempt to “understand” the human motives underlying the emergence of economic institutions and processes.</blockquote>\\r\\nMurray claims the study of motive is essentially subjective, but he offers an objective mechanism. Asking \\\"cui bono?\\\" helps objectively establish motive because people are teleological. For such people perceived incentives are motives. <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/other/criminal-investigation-and-intelligent-design/\\\">Criminal investigators may do something comparable</a>. Economists also have the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference\\\">tool of revealed preference</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we essentially have a strong argument that people act in order to achieve perceived personal benefits. When a person has a perceived personal interest in saying X, but X is not true, that is when we run into the real issue of bias leading to falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to note that such incentives neither imply nor exclude conscious dishonesty. I can have an interest in saying X and genuinely believe it to be true, even though it's not, or I might be intentionally lying.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne relevant case study occurs in the context of the intelligent design debate. <a href=\\\"http://www.discovery.org/\\\">The Discovery Institute</a> is an institution devoted to the study and advocacy of intelligent design. Stephen Meyer, one of the leading thinkers working with the institute, admits as much in the following C-SPAN interview at the 22:50 mark:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://youtu.be/UZTzMNRO_7I?t=22m50s\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the Discovery Institute is clearly biased in favor of intelligent design and they are rather straightforward about that. Does this mean that we should ignore or discount the material produced by DI? I think the answer is no.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recently <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/other/cambrian-explosion-nbd/\\\">criticized an article from Nick Matzke at Panda’s Thumb</a>. I updated my article after finding <a href=\\\"http://www.evolutionnews.org/2013/07/how_sudden_was_074511.html\\\">a similar article by DI</a> which presents even more information against Matzke. DI is in favor of ID, but are they are also correct:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>The actual author was Casey Luskin and <a href=\\\"http://www.evolutionnews.org/\\\">evolutionnews.org</a> is backed by DI. Luskin is a DI guy. This wasn't an official response but it might as well have been.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Matzke says the Cambrian Explosion took at least 30 million years. Luskin says expert opinion shows it was far shorter. In the article I wrote criticizing Matzke I show that most scientists show it around 20 M years.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Matzke says Meyers called the Cambrian Explosion \\\"instantaneous.\\\" Luskin states, and it is easily verified, that Meyers never said any such thing in the book.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Matzke also claimed the Cambrian Explosion wasn't particularly sudden. In contrast to Matzke's claim, most evolutionary biologists in the literature agree that it was sudden.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Matzke ignores Meyer's calculations in chapters 10 and 12 of Darwin's Doubt which demonstrate that even if the Cambrian lasted longer than 30 million years it would still be unexplained by standard principles of population genetics.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nLet me also clear up my position on ID while we are at it:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>Evolution is that it's a thing but it doesn't explain everything. ID is also that it's a thing but it doesn't explain everything. They both have some problems but they are both generally useful frameworks.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Macroevolution and chemical evolution have problems because they just don't fit the data. Evolution also has a problem in that it means different things which are often conflated. Evolution is also unfortunately perceived to exclude the truth of God, religion, and so on.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Intelligent design has a couple problems. It assumes a constant profile of intelligence and has a hard time dealing with the concept of levels of intelligence. Also, some of it's proponents think it must displace alternate theories rather than cooperate with them.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>I think ID deserves better consideration than it gets presently. I also don't think it has to be one or the other. Breeding, for example, is part each.</li>\\r\\n</ul>",

    "content": "This article will treat econometric method with economic analysis. There are three points of econometrics I would like to take issue with, based on economic reasoning:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Convenience data is bad</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Low n is bad</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Omitted variable bias is the only thing</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nI would like to argue against all three of these based on the decreasing marginal return of each factor, and the significant and important change from 0 to 1 units of each variable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree that convenience data is bad in the sense that its conclusions will be less certain and its results less valuable than the conclusions of another trial run in a similar way with superior data. However, superior data is more expensive to obtain. There is no such thing as perfect data, although more money will often buy you better data.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a decreasing marginal return to the quality of data. A less certain and valuable conclusion is sometimes preferable because benefit should outweigh cost and convenience data can be non-linearly cheaper than the alternative, and sometimes free.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bad experiment is one which yields no information. Using a survey because is a fine substitute for an elaborate observational study if it can produce a result, and if it doesn't produce a result there is still no room to criticize until the counterfactual is demonstrated as an effective alternative.\\r\\n\\r\\nSample size is a consideration of data quality and the same point applies, but it is perhaps a bit more clearly true. Consider a political surveys done in four trials and similar fashion. One trial has n = 1, n = 10, another n = 100, and another n = 500. I would make two points other researchers generally discount:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\t<li>Even the trial with n = 1 or n = 10 may result in superior signalling compared to n = 0.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>n = 500 in the real world has very little statistical advantage over n = 100, but it may have a substantially higher cost. Sometimes the cost outweighs the benefit.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nBottom line: If we want to maximize research productivity and output, it is imperative that researchers often use data <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>which is not</strong></span> the highest quality available.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast, omitted variable bias is not the only thing: Excessive variable bias is a thing. If you have to instruments measuring the same concept then the result may appear falsely insignificant. Moreover, the explanatory of the model has diminishing returns relative to the complexity, construction costs, and use costs of that model.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would also add that the professional obsession of researchers with OVB itself causes, I think, a bias toward having too many variables.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen an experiment where a researcher wanted to know the effect of income on calorie intake and they corrected for consumption of soda. They literally corrected for one of the things they were trying to explain. That's ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I think all reasonable people can quickly agree from the marginal cost minus marginal benefit argument that there is at least a Goldilocks number of variables, but I would go a bit further than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think there may be some Goldilocks model which we might call the rigorous model, but I think another useful framework is the single-variable model. This model does what models should do: It simplifies. Single-variable models allow us to be sure there is no bias in variable selection. <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/theoretical-development-and-application/statistics-evolved/\\\">As I said years ago</a>, \\\"Even if we correct for everything we can think of this is still a kind of selection bias.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo while researchers may denigrate single-variable models as the convenience data of models, I would encourage them to view such models in another light: They are the non-biased, gold standard, random sampling of the model world, and they often yield an immense return to complexity, construction, and use costs.",

    "title": "Problems With the SAT Score",
    "date": "2016-01-24",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Caplan, nudged by Garret Jones, <a href=\\\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/econlog_reading.html\\\">has begun a reading club</a> reviewing the determinants of long-run growth from a historical perspective. This school of thought, which I believe Jones has referred to as the Deep History Theory of Economic Growth, takes a parameter called the SAT score as somewhat critical. This article reviews some of my problems with that operationalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear, this has nothing to do with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT\\\">Scholastic Assessment Test</a> scores.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I get to the critique and proposed solutions, let me discuss, and indeed validate, the general purpose of a historical perspective on growth:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>A historical perspective on growth matters when we discuss mass migration of one society into another.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>In discussions on mass immigration, traditional research focuses on short-run effects. There is some discussion on the long-run, but it is generally in the elementary terms of the benefits of labor growth and consumer demand, ignoring more complex effects.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Traditional conclusions are plausibly dwarfed or even inverted by another consideration, the long-run socio-political effect of immigration, and particularly mass migration.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Following from 1, 2, and 3, the historical perspective allows us to make better informed policy decisions regarding immigration.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Outside of the immigration discussion, economics is in desperate need of better long-run forecasting tools and methods. Economists make the strongest claims in the long-run, but they have the weakest supporting statistical data about the long-run. This historic approach may allow economists to make long-run forecasts with better statistical precision.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Unfortunately, statistics follows the saying \\\"garbage in, garbage out.\\\" While better long-run forecasting is attractive in theory, the historical approach will serve only as another thorn in the side of economists if the operationalization is done incorrectly, which would lead to worse forecasts rather than better ones. That's why this article here matters.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThe SAT score is an operationalization of Deep History Theory. That is, the SAT score is a kind of data which can be used to implement, test, and judge DHT. The SAT score may be defined this way:\\r\\n<blockquote>Countries now inhabited by the descendants of historically advanced civilizations do much better than countries now inhabited by descendants of historically backwards civilizations.  How do they measure \\\"advanced\\\" and \\\"backward\\\"?  Several ways, especially state history (S), dawn of agriculture (A), and technology in 1500 AD (T).</blockquote>\\r\\nMy issues with the SAT score:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Technology at 1500 AD is not deep history, it is recent history.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>A true <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_history\\\">deep history theory</a> should spread back millions of years to the earliest known time of mankind, or at least as early as we have good data.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>It's true that we basically only have bones and natural data of limited use if we go back hundreds of thousands of years,</li>\\r\\n\t<li>But we have useful socio-economic data describing the ancient world: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Greece#Bronze_Age\\\">Greece</a>, China, America, and India, as well as a few other <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization\\\">Cradles of Civilization</a>. Good data is hard to find before 3000 BC, but it is hard not to find by 1000 BC, where we even have good data on many civilizations other than the Cradles, such as Israel.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The objection to deep history is much more than a semantic problem. I am arguing that the previous implementation of the SAT score is fundamentally a bad operationalization.</li>\\r\\n\t<li><a href=\\\"http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/125/4/1627.full.pdf\\\">Putterman and Weil</a> appeal to the Neolithic Revolution at one. That's real deep history! The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution\\\">Neolithic Revolution</a> began earlier than 10,000 BC, so why are we using 1500 AD for the SAT score? There's some strong out-of-sample risk here for any conclusions drawn.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Technology in 1500 AD is a non-useful magic number.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>It would be much better for econometrics to have the entity described in this parameter as trend data instead of a point value at a relatively random date.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>A more sound approach, in my opinion, would be to identify the starting point and find at least 3-5 evenly dispersed dates at which to sample the technology level.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>3-5 dates allows us to weakly capture the curvature of the trend data.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Ideally, we would have a large sample of years with which to construct some panel data. Perhaps 50-100+ dates, and perhaps randomly rather than evenly disbursed in that case.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Technology is poorly measured.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>sss</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Civilization is poorly measured.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>In the article cited above, Putterman and Weil state \\\"For these reasons, whenever possible we have used genetic evidence as the basis for dividing the ancestry of modern mixed groups that account for large fractions of their country's population.\\\"\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Then, perhaps worse, they state, \\\"By 'large' we mean 30% or greater.\\\" So we are perhaps ignoring up to 70% of the information contained in the biological diversity of any particular civilization's population.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>They say \\\"In cases where genetic evidence on the ancestry of mixed groups was not available, we relied on textual accounts and/or generalizations...\\\" That is not a very rigorous solution.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Don't get me wrong, I don't fault them for using what is available, I just mean when we shouldn't be terribly confident in any conclusions drawn from this approach.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The problem is that most civilizations, particularly those with advanced technology, have very usually had mixed ethnic makeup. American and Roman civilizations make for the most obvious examples, but did you know that ancient Egypt and Babylonia were ethnically diverse? You might be tempted to think that ancient <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Chinese_history\\\">China</a> and <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India\\\">India</a> form exceptions, but not so.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Put another way, modern biologists can't figure out how to <a href=\\\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3000998/Are-Welsh-truest-Brits-English-genomes-contain-German-French-DNA-Romans-left-no-trace.html\\\">genetically define a modern Englishman</a>, so how could we possibly define an ancient a representative ancient American?</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li>This creates three problems:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Orphaned ethnicity problem: The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people\\\">Tibetan People</a> are ostensibly from Tibet, which is in China, right? However, India has always had significant numbers of Tibetans. The real problem is that neither the representative genetic makeup of China nor India looks Tibetan. What's a poor orphaned Tibetan to do?</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Orphaned civilization problem: Just as you can have an ethnicity with no counterpart civilization under this scheme, so you can also have a civilization with no counterpart ethnicity. What is the genetic profile of an ancient Roman anyway? Is it pretty much the genetic profile of an Italian? Nope. Rome was of course the geographic source of the ancient Roman empire, but if you look at the ancient Roman's citizens over time and found the median or mean citizen, he would not be ethnically Italian. They were the source but ultimately a minority.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>Ironically, the Romans were historically opposed to the northern Germans, but their genetics would never reveal this socio-political issue in history. Since the SAT score is meant to capture that very thing, socio-political and historical issues, it seems we have run into an issue in method.</li>\\r\\n\t<li>The third issue is that mixing matters. <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo\\\">Mestizos</a> are of mixed European and Native American ancestry. Perhaps they are more than 30% of each. How would Putterman and Weil treat this category? In either case, whether they treated them as essentially European or essentially Native American, they would be grossly imprecise and basically wrong. Mestizos have had a unique socio-political and historical history compared to either the Europeans and the Native Americans.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\t<li>Of course, Mestizos weren't really around in 1500, but this is just a convient way to dodge the issue. Mixing is a general event, not just one affecting Latin America.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\t<li></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

Given 3 columns in a data set, a machine would run 3! = 3*2*1 OLS regressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more sophisticated program would allow for k types of regressions (OLS, quadratic, cubic, log...), so a more full factorial analysis might be k(n!).\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Section 2: The Problem</p>\\r\\nThe computer would assert the ideal regression, rather than the biased whims of an analyst.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch an analysis would represent a humble approach: Learning from the data instead of searching for evidence of a preferred answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/68181/performing-all-possible-regressions-in-r\\\">Here is a data analysis stack exchange post</a> where an individual asks how to do exactly what I described as a factorial regression, using R.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gets shot down by like everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne reason rings out: data-mining bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I am here to tell you: No amount of data-mining bias can overcome the benefits of data-mining.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhoa what? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe error introduced by randomly guessing can be corrected for through <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\\\">Bonferroni</a> or <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0id%C3%A1k_correction\\\">Sidak</a> Correction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, none of these corrections will penalize the first-winning regression in such a way that the second-winning regression ever becomes preferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrections will reduce our confidence in the first-winning regression, and perhaps to such an extent that we see no significant winners; but it will always preserve the rank order of model quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm certainly a pragmatist: If your intuition happens to lead you into a great model, use it! Bayesian results are often more straightforward to interpret, test, and use. However, there is forever some element of bias which can't be rooted out from the Bayesian approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn real life, however, the benefits of many models outweigh whatever insignificant bias might remain from a Bayesian input.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, in some situations a Bayesian model might be more difficult: What if you are so unfamiliar with a data context or so unconvinced by any apparent intuition that you can't generate a meaningful Bayesian input, hypothesis, or theory? Then a pure mathematical descriptive, exploratory approach may be best.\\r\\n\\r\\nA factor analysis, including a factor regression, is a great addition to any <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis\\\">Exploratory Data Analysis</a> (EDA). Why choose between Bayes and Bonferroni? Use them both in your EDA and discuss the differences!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, be careful: Data-mining can result in some weird models. These models should generally not be interpreted causally, or even at all, without further research and causal reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, data-mined models will produce mathematically optimal forecasts and expectations when given new data that fits the model.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimplification makes interpretation easier, but it doesn't make for more accurate analysis or forecasting. Data mining models makes interpretation hard, but it's technically useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably some balance is efficient: I'm just trying to argue against dismissing data mining out of hand. It's a useful technique.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimplification of models into theory can also happen in many ways: I vote for emergent simplification over imposed simplification:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Emergent simplification takes an algorithmically produced model and systematically eliminates minimally beneficial parameters until a useful or meaningful model remains.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Imposed simplification takes the intuition of an analyst and seeks to extract affirmation out of a data set.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Section 3: One Possible Solution</p>\\r\\nGoing back to how this program might work...k(n!) is just the beginning! Given a data set with age as a column, a skilled analyst might recognize that certain factors might be increasing or decreasing in marginal age.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo a cool machine would be able to generate age^2 and age^3 and test those as factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibilities are infinite - which is kind of cool and also kind of bad, because that can make such a program hard to create.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne solution would be a measure of complexity and a user-specified complexity cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accuracy of a model would be reasonably expected to gain with a diminishing marginal effect with respect to complexity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe input of processing power and time required to execute a program of linearly increasing complexity is reasonably expected to increase exponentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn combination with small data, however, this is a one-two punch for extracting powerful, user-tailored data in a cheap, feasible way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sort of analysis can yield insightful and unexpected results. Here's another advantage: It destroys overconfidence bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Because the analyst has not asserted a hypothesis to test and they have not selected the search space of models.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it may still be a fair criticism that the analyst may have selected the data set, but there are a few simple retorts to such a criticism:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>No I didn't! Many large data sets are established and analysts are essentially data-takers.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Yes. On purpose! Data optimized for application is often selected from a small pool on purpose - eg \\\"I only care about my customers, not the whole market\\\"</li>\\r\\n \t<li>True, but the result is easily reproduced with other data sets.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>True, but it's better than if I had a weird data set <em>and</em> overconfidence bias!</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nOf course, none of those retorts hold up to evidence that the data set is truly tampered with.\\r\\n\\r\\nTangentially: Genetic optimizations are kind of like this factorial thing, because models can emerge from data rather than being imposed on the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic optimization is one kind of regression that scientists are usually pretty interested in using it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's also an awesome Javascript library for it. <a href=\\\"http://subprotocol.com/system/genetic-regression-curve.html\\\">Demo</a>. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/subprotocol/genetic-js\\\">Github</a>.",

    "date": "2016-09-06",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article responds to a specific section of <a href=\\\"http://www.owl232.net/biblequotes.htm\\\">Michael Huemer's Scary Bible Quotes</a>, \\\"On Slavery and Subjugation of Women.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an answer to <a href=\\\"http://www.owl232.net/biblecomments.htm\\\">Question 5 in his introduction</a>, Michael Huemer claims his quotes are in context. I will echo his other critics and argue at least one of his points is definitively not in context.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first point about \\\"Subjugation of Women\\\" is Ephesians 5:22-24:\\r\\n<blockquote>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</blockquote>\\r\\nIn context, we read that men must reciprocally love their wives. <a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:22-33\\\">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>:\\r\\n<blockquote><span id=\\\"en-NIV-29330\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-25\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">25 </sup>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29331\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-26\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">26 </sup>to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29332\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-27\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">27 </sup>and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29333\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-28\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">28 </sup>In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29334\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-29\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">29 </sup>After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29335\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-30\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">30 </sup>for we are members of his body.</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29336\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-31\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">31 </sup>“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29337\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-32\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">32 </sup>This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.</span> <span id=\\\"en-NIV-29338\\\" class=\\\"text Eph-5-33\\\"><sup class=\\\"versenum\\\">33 </sup>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</span></blockquote>\\r\\nThis paints a picture very much other than that which Huemer paints. This is not a picture of <a href=\\\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/subjugation\\\">subjugation</a> or enslavement. The Christian marriage is a relationship where man and woman are co-equal, but possess different roles. Neither the man nor the woman controls the other. Rather, all choices should be made jointly by the husband and wife. This sometimes entails deferring categories of chores or decisions to one or the other person depending on relative strengths.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a decision requires leadership, which they sometimes do, it is the role of the husband to lead, but this is not to say the wife becomes a slave. Both people are better off with a house that has good leadership. I would also say that it may not always be the case that the husband is the leader, although I think it is the usual case. There are marriages where the wife wears the pants so to speak. This isn't an immoral situation, it's a specialization in roles. I think it's an interesting but unrelated theological curiosity as to whether a wife skilled in leadership should adopt the role of head of household or train up the husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuemer has a few other points under this section:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Regarding deference to authority - 1 Peter 2:13 Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every authority instituted among men.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>It's possible for God to grant authority to <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/ancap-thoughts/\\\">government</a> without rendering them morally perfect or licensed.

    "date": "2016-09-11",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article makes a moral argument for polycentrism from Misesian efficiency. This article argues that rational action under a Misesian framework can be interpreted as a revealed subjective moral preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, a free market composed of rational actors will optimize at a position which is not only efficient from the viewpoint of real production or utility, but also from the viewpoint of subjective moral analysis. Subjective moral optimization is the same type of optimization which justifies policy action in a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy\\\">Representative Democracy</a>. Optimal social policy is better designed by a market in comparison to a representative democratic political structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe view that the free market is morally optimizing seems compatible with several schools of economic thought, but not in the same sense. Other schools of economic thought might see morality as a good or a component of a good, as an externality, as an indulgence, and so on, then proceed to demonstrate that a free market optimizes the supply and demand of such a good. Austrian Economics, as I understand it, entails subjective morality to be an intrinsic characteristic of action.\\r\\n\\r\\nMisesian efficiency as I am using the term refers to the outcome on a free market, as described by <a href=\\\"https://mises.org/system/tdf/Human%20Action_3.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document\\\">Ludwig von mises in Human Action</a>. Mises defines human action tautologically as <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Teleology&amp;oldid=736671268#Teleology_and_economics\\\">teleological</a> and necessarily rational. Mises gives a few requirements for human action, as presented by <a href=\\\"http://www.ccoyne.com/\\\">Dr. Chris Coyne</a>:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>A certain felt uneasiness\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>One must feel displeasure with the status quo</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>An imagined preferred state of affairs\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>One must perceive a state of affairs that improves upon this uneasiness</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Expectations about the means available\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>One must believe that the means to bring about the preferred state are available</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Time\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>One must have an understanding of past, present, and future in order to recognize a preferred state of affairs</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Uncertainty\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>One must believe that the future is not predetermined</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Causality and Causal Relations\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>One must believe that action will achieve (i.e., “cause”) the imagined, preferred state of affairs</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nTangentially, I don't find #5 to be necessary for action, but it is certainly an important component of consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is #2 in particular which allows us to interpret teleologically optimal action as <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference\\\">revealed preference</a> for some subjective moral position.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moral position is a value statement, judgement, normative statement, and so on, in contrast to a mere observation or positive statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule of thumb, any statement like \\\"X is good,\\\" \\\"X is better than Y,\\\" or \\\"X should be\\\" is a normative statement, and accordingly also a moral statement, judgement, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy imagining a preferred state of affairs and desiring such state of affairs, in particular to the point of action, an individual has revealed that they judge the sought end state to be better than the status quo.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some objections to this notion, along with my responses:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>People frequently identify a particular moral code as optimal, but then, in particular cases, violate that moral code.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Then they have revealed through action, which I trust more than survey, that their moral code is <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY\\\">consequentialist, even though they thought it was categorical</a>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>This is not inconsistent with holding some category in generally high regard, but making exceptions where the cost is particularly or impracticably high.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>People's actions often vary in the context of differing costs and environments\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>I reiterate the answer from point 1.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>While a true assertion, is does nothing to undermine the fact that such actions are revealing a moral preference, it simply indicates the moral code is a consequentialist one.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The way I employ the concept of morality is not the ordinary way most people use the term when talking casually.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>True, and I don't take that as a criticism. The way I employ the term is the technical way in which economists discriminating between positive and normative assertions use the term, and also the way moral philosophers and others use the term.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Exacting policy per se is immoral due to the immorality of the coercive nature of the state. Therefore even to advocate free market policies is an immoral act.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>This logic doesn't follow due to the fact that free market policies reduce and ultimately eliminate the state as a monopoly on the use of force.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If state coercion is defined as immorality, then free market policies are correspondingly de facto pro-moral.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article argues that a singularity-like event in the market for defense would be a watershed moment in the transformation of a mixed economy to polycentric governance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI won't be calculating a date in the context of this article.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne explanation for the existence of government is that government itself is the emergent output of a market. A bit less naive than that plain statement would be the idea that government emerged as the output of some market at some point in time and has since that time found itself resilient to market correction. In this sense government is sticky in the way that <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity\\\">prices</a> or employment might be sticky, but to a much larger degree due to public choice incentives among other factors. This extreme stickiness, or entrenchment, can be eliminated by a combination of supply-side and demand-side effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know many people who have studied economics and come to the conclusion that polycentric governance is a bad idea, but many object that it is either impossible or else possible but many years away from feasibility, such that it's not particularly useful for discussion today.\\r\\n\\r\\nI disagree. A few years ago I wrote about <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/theoretical-development-and-application/5-routes-to-anarchy/\\\"><em>5 Routes to Anarchy</em></a>. Since that time it appears that society has continued at a strong pace along all 5 routes. The <a href=\\\"http://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-seasteading-institute-2016-9\\\">Seasteading Institute has begun to work publicly</a> with French Polynesia, cryptographic technology has advanced further than ever before, and the first semi-serious attempt at <a href=\\\"https://www.cnet.com/news/asgardia-will-be-a-new-nation-in-space-and-you-can-be-a-citizen/\\\">a nation in space</a> has been proposed. Peter Leeson also wrote a thing about so-called <a href=\\\"http://www.peterleeson.com/Celestial_Anarchy.pdf\\\">Celestial Anarchy</a>. As always, some degree of subversive anarchy also persists, although that's not my preferred route.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose developments are cool and, except subversive anarchy, they can be seen as supply-side moves to improve the market for anarchy. Technology, research, and social changes have also helped convergence toward realization of a polycentric system from the demand side. Academic research continues to flow in that the market does stuff well and the government does stuff terribly, and the population has really started paying attention to how terribly central government is lately. In 2015 Gallup found <a href=\\\"http://www.cato.org/blog/gallup-finds-more-libertarians-electorate\\\">the number Libertarians in the electorate</a> at and all time high and trending further up. In 2016, Gary Johnson has polled as high as 13% (is that a record?) and may be most-voted Libertarian candidate in history later this year, even while he is a mediocre libertarian on principle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo people are becoming more libertarian and market-oriented. In addition, our need for public services is decreasing, thanks to technology. <a href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/03/16/finally-a-flying-car-could-go-on-sale-as-soon-as-2017/#636790d0219e\\\">Flying cars seem to be coming soon</a>. Perhaps most importantly, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Defense_Distributed&amp;oldid=739508895\\\">Defense Distributed</a> kicked off the open source revolution for weapons, then further facilitated cheap and distributed weaponry with the Ghost Gunner in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly on in <a href=\\\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf\\\">The Machinery of Freedom</a>, David Friedman states, \\\"property is a central economic institution of any society, and private property is the central institution of a free society.\\\" I'm actually not convinced anything more than private property, people, and gains from trade (net of transaction costs) are needed for the formation of markets. Cheap weaponry allows people to ensure their own property rights without the help of government. After all, a property right is ultimately no more than a de facto claim to property, perhaps attenuated to some degree by the institutional context of the transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically I want to argue that when distributed military power reaches a critical mass it will result in a dramatic decrease in the demand for central government. Cheap guns are great, but even a large supply of guns doesn't really compare to the capability of modern armies, in particular the military of the USA, so we aren't there yet. How far off are we? I would suggest that cryptocurrency is viable at this point, so if distributed weaponry can obtain an equivalent position relative to an appropriate standard it will also be viable. Calculating that would actually be relatively complex and I won't do it here, but that is a decent starting point I think.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment is frequently an offender of property rather than a protector of property. Contrary to the thoughts of some, it is certainly not needed to ensure property rights. Friedman argues through The Machinery of Freedom and elsewhere that property rights can be produced on the market, and his view seems to be increasingly common among others. Put these facts together and we can see some reason on why demand for central governance is decreasing. The sharing economy and crowd sourcing are becoming increasingly common and not exotic to ordinary people, so over time I expect that the ideas of crowd sourced defense and law will seem obvious to ordinary people as well as scholars.",

    "title": "Virtual Competition Solves Geographic Monopoly",
    "date": "2016-11-03",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article defines virtual competition and argues that it is a mechanism to solve geographic monopoly.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirtual competition is competition conducted through exchanges of information. Financial competition, reputation, marketing, and so on are all subsets of virtual competition. Such mechanisms can lead to the displacement of an unproductive producer of physical goods, even if that producer is in a position of geographic monopoly. It may also displace other forms of market control, but I want to focus on geographic monopoly here.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Because I was on the train earlier and it was bothering me. There is a common and straightforward argument for intervention: certain goods and services can only be provided by means of a geographic monopoly. In particular, transportation, power lines, and phone lines. Such providers may abuse market power and therefore government must step in and defend the consumer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are maybe 4 pro-market responses I can think of:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>The public choice response is that government isn't really benevolent. In some cases they are systematically worse abusers of the average individual compared to a market monopolist.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Innovation can overcome the need for government intervention. For example, mobile phones and satellite technology reduce the need for phone lines. For cars the equivalent would be maybe a flying car.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Another argument is that there is no clear reason to defend consumers rather than producers. After all, both are ultimately just people. Most people are employed, meaning they are producers, but they are also consumers. The unemployed are a special group to consider, but they are already singled out for special care by various public and private programs.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The argument from virtual competition.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nVirtual competition can allow displacement of a low-quality provider through a buyout in the following way:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Reputation and information sharing allow individuals in a geographic area to notice that a producer of a similar service in another geographic area is a better fit.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Those individuals can negotiate with the current producer and the foreign producer to negotiate a buyout of the current producer.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Optionally, the new contract might contain good behavior clauses tied to financial incentives.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nInstead of coordinating a buyout, the individuals might coordinate to produce a new technology, organize and broadcast demand for a substitute service, organize a boycott to pressure the current producer directly, or coordinate by other means.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote the fluid reference to individuals as consumers and as investors. This is key and I think economics in general can benefit from focus on individuals and objects rather than producers, consumers, goods, and bads. Because a particular individual in one context is a consumer and in another context is a producer, and a particular object in one context can be a good and in another context it can be a bad. For example, people in the real world have bliss points and eating a sandwich is good while eating 10 sandwiches just might make you throw up.",

    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "The main thrust of this response is to note the relationship between giving and the desire for reciprocity as a determinant of futurism. Under monocentric administration, aggregation of charitable givers results in a loss of identifiable social values. A receiver engaging in thankful reciprocity will be unable to reciprocate in the social terms of the givers, and will instead reciprocate in what is believed to be the social terms of the administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper reviewed [Tuszynski, 2016] asserts, “It is a natural human inclination to desire to help those in need.” I agree, and I would add that another basic human inclination is to experience thankfulness and a desire to reciprocate after receiving a gift. In the case of charitable giving, the paper reviewed asserts that the giver often desires futurity. That is, a giver is usually more satisfied by the prospect of improving the life of the recipient both immediately and permanently than they would be satisfied by the prospect of improving the life of the recipient only immediately and not permanently.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thankful receiver may realize the wants of the giver and attempt to reciprocate. An alert receiver may realize he is able to render a service which will give the giver some utility. Specifically, the receiver can engage in self-change in ways which will please the giver. The receiver might also simply assume behaviors or beliefs which are considered to belong to the giver due to the logical possibility that the giver’s status is due to the giver’s beliefs or behaviors. This second story is more about the receiver seeking self-improvement rather than engaging in reciprocity. Indeed, if we can step away from the present analysis and look at economics writ large, it is generally considered true that an individual’s social and human capital is a determinant of that individual’s productivity, income, and success.\\r\\n\\r\\nA third story gets us to the same place. The first two stories are receiver-driven, where the receiver independently engages in self-change. Another story is giver-driven. In giver-driven cases the giver might request that a giver adopt certain beliefs or behaviors. A giver might even make such requirements contractual conditions of charity. A request-type example might be a Christian missionary who gives some food or clothing away freely but includes a religious pamphlet and some verbal encouragement to consider the pamphlet alongside the gift. A contract-type example might be a drug test as a precondition for food stamp eligibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe receiver-driven and giver-driven approaches are importantly similar and also importantly different. One key difference exists in the incentives. The giver-driven approach incentivizes observable conformance, but it also presents incentives for a potential receiver to game, cheat, or lie. The receiver-driven approach is perhaps a less frequent story, and it is not associated with any incentive to cheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe similarity between these two approaches is that either case ends with a transfer of social values or human capital from the giver to the receiver. The result is a transfer from the giver to the receiver of some notion or information regarding the way the receiver ought to behave. On this view it is possible in principle for the act of charity to directly cause futurity for the reasons previously discussed. In some way this renders charity a bit like a training program. The information might be technical, or it might be some general social capital or appreciation for fellow man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to realize that in any case the terms human capital, social capital, and so on are general terms for aggregations of specific quantities of various kinds of information which are exchanged. Such information is subjective in the sense that it originates in the mind of the giver, although such origination may of course have a mix of prior determinants. An important point is that such information is not taken as some objective truth, but it is instead a view of the giver.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent kinds of individuals engage in charity. Religious folks and non-religious folks both give to charity, but even among religious folks the specific sets of beliefs vary wildly. For example, a Mormon and a Muslim might both give food to a poor person, but Islam and Mormonism are entirely different sets of beliefs. Consequently, while the Muslim and the Mormon would either transfer some kind of social or human capital to the receiver, they would absolutely not transfer the same kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen charity is administered by the state it is sourced from many kinds of givers. The result is that any particular receiver does not have a direct connection to one kind of giver, so the multi-specific value transfer is lost. Instead, the receiver can only receive two kinds of social or human capital. One kind is a perceived common ground value exchange and the other is an exchange of state values.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common ground value exchange might proceed as follows. The receiver imagines all possible or likely givers and attempts to deduce any overlap of specific beliefs which might be held by all such individuals. Thinking back to the Mormon and the Muslim, we can see that there is only very mild overlap. The overlap is so little that any individual holding only to such beliefs would not be viewed as a proper Mormon or a proper Muslim. Now consider that the state-receiver must include the atheist and the agnostic into the pool of potential givers and the common ground is even further watered down. It is possible that the watering down may be so severe that there is literally no common ground left. Or, there may be certain basic values left in common such as the desire to treat each other well, not lie, not steal, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state value exchange occurs when the receiver desires to reciprocate directly with the state, or else the receiver confuses the state as a true representative of the values of the original givers. In such a case the receiver will look to whatever the state deems to be good or correct beliefs or behaviors. The receiver may also begin to think highly of whatever constitutes the essence and motive of the state. The receiver might be particularly susceptible to state propaganda, the opinions of contemporary political leadership, politically correct thought and behaviors, or politically trends thought or behaviors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state, or at least the underlying political parties, might appreciate this state of dependency or even seek to foster a codependent relationship with the impoverished. Such a relationship is easily transformed into a scheme for cheap votes. This relationship becomes politically sustainable, although perhaps socially and economically destructive. That is, a party promising welfare in exchange for votes obtains a political and rhetorical advantage in a system where the vote of an impoverished individual is weighted on equal terms with the vote of a high income individual. In theory, a better system would obtain weighted votes. Weighting on income is perhaps second best and the real goal is to weight on productivity. Such a political system in the extreme converges to the market itself, where individuals receive payments directly equal to their own marginal productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that the representative Samaritan is unable to pose a credible disciplinary threat in the direction of an aid recipient is certainly true, and the logic of the aider of last resort seems well-formed, but it seems to only reflect on one side of the incentive problem. The state lacks a stick, but I would propose that it is unwilling to use the carrot. In theory, the state could provide subsidies which incentivize an impoverished individual to pull themselves out of poverty. In fact, there are many cases where the state does this in practice. Job training programs and subsidies for education are two examples. Another notable subsidy intended for the poor and also the middle class is home loan legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch policies lead to a variety of unintended consequences. For example, job programs are largely ineffective and education subsidies serve largely to inflate the cost of education. It could even be well argued in theory, although empirical work would be appreciated to make a strong case, that state charity subsidy and regulation have resulted in misallocation of resources to charity. An analyst would expect an excess quantity compared to a natural rate, and also the appearance of the wrong kinds or implementations of charitable enterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome loan legislation is a key explanatory variable in the Great Recession, and in general subsidies tend to create bubbles which collapse and damage the economy in the long run. All of these unintended consequences are not the main thrust of this paper, but it is worth noting that the hypothetical use of the carrot by the state is entirely not hypothetical, and it is also worth noting how such instances have played out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the state has in many cases attempted to use the carrot, the state is also presented with a moral hazard to the effect that it is expected to prefer the carrot to a lesser degree compared to the market. That moral hazard is provided through the same mechanism previously discussed, the one in which a state-like actor intentionally fosters a codependent relationship with the impoverished as a scheme to obtain cheap votes. A state-like actor may include, as previously noted, the state itself or and underlying party or set of parties. The state-like actor’s tactic can be labeled policy predation, or political predation, and the resultant behavior of voters predictably becoming attracted rather than repulsed by such predation is identifiable as a political variant of Stockholm Syndrome.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the analogy, which is intended more as a serious hypothesis than a simple analogy, it is worth a brief aside to discuss the way Stockholm Syndrome is generally remedied by psychologists. The interesting result is that there is no known cure and indeed very little formal research has been carried out on the subject. A meta-analysis conducted in 2007 found only 12 papers meeting the inclusion criteria [Namnayak, 2008]. The meta-analysis further found that there was ambiguity in the use of the term and the research was largely constituted by case studies. In the 12 papers there were 5 case studies and 4 of them contained significant overlapping features. The paper concluded that there have been no validated diagnostic criteria for Stockholm Syndrome and certainly no known cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have discussed political predation in the case of poverty at length, but it is worth taking a step back and noting that political predation is a general and indeed necessary component of most political systems we see in the world. In particular, is it a necessary component of political systems involving a central government or monocentric administration. The tendency for predation is expected to be particularly potent with a concentration of power, or inverse the number of parties. In this sense, the closest thing a Democracy can bear to a dictatorship is a 2-party system, and a parliamentary system is expected to engage in predation a bit less.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worth noting the empirical fact that European countries are historically more often parliamentary and historically more often to pass welfare legislation. Such an empirical fact might present a problem for the proposed pattern that multi-party governments will tend to pass less predatory policy. A simple confounder would be culture, and it is also worth noting that in modern times the United States does not pass significantly less welfare legislation anyway. The pattern is one of a past era. So I don’t think the problem is there, but it is worth some further discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, parties always engage in votes-for-policies schemes. This is the entire purpose of their constitution, and in some ways it is both legitimate and desired. However, the logic of predation permeates all such schemes to the effect that any party or state will have an incentive not only to fulfill the needs of voters, but indeed to create a state of need and dependence on the part of voters. Parties will specialize in such predation in a vote-maximizing way, so it is not as if all parties will cater to the poor, which in some ways might have been nice. Instead, some will cater to this or that group, but the catering is predatory and self-serving in nature rather than genuinely beneficent as we should expect from a true Samaritan.\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations:\\r\\n\\r\\nNamnyak, M., Tufton, N., Szekely, R., Toal, M., Worboys, S. and Sampson, E.

    "content": "This article is a long-winded attempt to describe a very elusive sort of mental activity which I think exists, as part of a larger description of human behavior which may eventually support an agent based model or an analytical framework.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few straightforward kinds of conscious mental action which may be numerated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Notice/Observe/Capture a portion of a stream of perceivable information.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Calculate/Consider/Evaluate captured information. This includes asking, answering and comparing.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Judge/Select/Prefer/Choose/Rank/Compare/Prioritize</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThen there is at least one other sort of mental activity which is less conscious or even unconscious:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Direct/Try/Exert Effort/Will/Focus</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nThe terms given above all refer to the same activity I am trying to describe, which I refer to as immediate mental direction. This is the mental activity responsible for handling immediate tasks, whether physical or mental. Under mental activity type 3 I can choose to go for a walk, but perhaps that preference will be actualized some time later. If I choose to walk under this fourth type of mental activity, in contrast, I am directing my legs to move in some direction immediately after or simultaneously with my thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not actually sure if this mental activity occurs immediately prior or simultaneously with the physical act, but I do know that in normal circumstances your hand will not draw a cup of water to your mouth unless you want it to, which is the concept I'm trying to convey here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis concept is so elusive to me that I would like to claim it doesn't exist, except that it also appears to be the best explanation of certain phenomena. For example, the non-moving hand mentioned just prior. It may also explain the behavior of a person who is said to be driving \\\"on autopilot\\\" and makes a right hand turn instead of a left hand turn \\\"without thinking.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAny model should consider that this mental activity can be conducted with varying degrees of effort. I can urgently direct my hand to grab a cup of water and throw it on my burning hair, or I can casually direct my hand to grasp the last spoon of soup, since I'm not very hungry, but you know, I have to finish my soup right? Because of mental exhaustion and recovery, we can treat this varying level of effort as essentially the spending of a kind of self-synthesizing mental income.",

    "content": "This article discusses notions of economic efficiency, notes a main one employed by applied economists to be Kaldor-Hicks efficiency, and discusses a few issues with that concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some kinds of economic efficiency:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Pareto efficiency - loved by theorists but <a href=\\\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e854/pc1.htm\\\">not feasible</a>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>It means a move which improves utility of at least one agent and reduces the utility of no agent</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency\\\">Kaldor-Hicks</a> efficiency - sometimes employed by theorists and practically useful\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>It means a move which improves total surplus, even if some particular agents lose utility</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Technical efficiency - used on occasion in micro theory and practically useful to some degree\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>It means cost minimization for a given objective. Eg produce X units in the cheapest way possible.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/unpacking-vandivier-coase-theorem/\\\">Nonremediableness</a> - obscure but Oliver Williamson used it and I approve.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Absence of market failure - Depending on your definition of market failure, you can be in a kaldor-hicks inefficient position or a technically inefficient position, but there is no market failure.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Eg David Friedman's definition: Market failure is when individual preference does not lead to a group-optimal result. This might be called a Smithian failure eg the invisible hand didn't work.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Or the Williamson definition: The outcome may not be kaldor-hicks efficient but it is not feasibly remediable. So these concepts do overlap.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Alternatively, others define market failure specifically as a kaldor-hicks inefficient result on the market.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Exhaustion of gains from trade.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nIn applied work most economists use Kaldor-Hicks efficiency. For example, when doing a cost-benefit analysis of some proposed policy like a change to a tax. Consider a reduction in the income tax. In a shallow way this seems to be a pareto improvement. Who could be opposed? Isn't this financially a strict gain for everyone? But practically in the real world people get pissed even about stuff like this. Someone might say \\\"Why is the income tax reduction even across the board? Shouldn't we provide a bigger reduction for the poor and a smaller reduction for the rich?\\\" If anyone voices such an opinion then they suffered some disutility from the change and it cannot be considered a pareto improvement, even if it is a kaldor-hicks improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a counter-argument by fans of pareto-improvements that we can just compensate the losers, but practically this doesn't happen. Even when it does happen the reimbursements accrue to a subset of the appropriate people and a value of reimbursement which is often one-size-fits-all and otherwise suboptimal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo anyway, folks use Kaldor-Hicks. It's pretty good but is it flawless? Hardly. Here are some issues:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Issues in measuring willingness to pay.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Issues in lexicographic preference, infinite, and set theory\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>aka perfectly inelastic demand or vertical demand</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Shout out to the brilliant <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/SladeMendenhall\\\">Slade Mendenhall</a> for reminding me of the word lexicographic</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Standard vs modified Kaldor-Hicks</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nI. Issues in willingness to pay (WTP):\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Limited expressiveness\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Traditional WTP is constrained by income. You can't actually pay more money than you have.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>This limits <a href=\\\"https://electology.org/expressiveness-approval-vs-ranked-ballots\\\">expressiveness</a> in the sense of political science and voting systems.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>In some contexts this is good: We don't care about person X's unconstrained demand, we want their constrained demand which contains info about their productivity, intelligence, etc.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Except some people are poor by coincidence or nature: In other words there is a misleading signal going by their endowment alone. Sometimes smart folks are born poor.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Looking at unconstrained demand or demand as a share of income might be more expressive.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>But, consider the extrema of even share of income: 0 and 100%.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>You could have two things which you would not pay for either one, but you still prefer one if given the choice of free consumption.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Or, you have two things you would pay everything for, but you would choose one if forced. Eg my life or my wife's: I would pay all for either but I would save hers if forced to choose.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Constrained vs unconstrained demand (kind of related to <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/true-demand/\\\">this old post</a> I had forgotten about)\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Continuing along point 1.6.2, consider this: I would pay all my possible income to save my own life, but I would also pay that much to save my wife's life. Call this value I(L). So what is my willingness to pay for both of our lives? Traditional WTP would say it is still only I(L), but common sense might tell us we should add these values and get 2I(L). On further reflection we might say, \\\"Actually, if I had more than 2I(L) available, I would pay an arbitrarily high amount! My WTP is infinite!\\\" This creates an issue the traditional analyst avoids by only allowing the constrained values, but I have another approach which may be more expressive that will be discussed later with vertical demand.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>WTP is a point value but future income follows a forecasting distribution: I'm not certain of my future income, it could fall in some range. Unconstrained demand better addresses this. What if I have X dollars, what if I have Y dollars? I wouldn't buy this car with my current income, but if I got a raise of $X then I might buy it. Or, try to calculate discounted lifetime income under the consideration that the real interest rate is uncertain: You can get a point estimate but a real statistician would prefer a confidence interval since no particular point has a substantive likelihood.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Bliss points are things and it would be useful in some economic contexts to identify an agent's bliss point, but this point might fall outside their constrained demand or current income.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Willingness to pay vs willingness to accept: <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883536/\\\">These guys have better details than me</a>.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nII. Issues in lexicographic preference, infinite, and set theory:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>As discussed in II.1.6.2 and II.2.1, my unconstrained demand for some good might be infinite. And yet we as humans are capable of ranking the preference of these goods. For example, I can value my life infinitely and the life of my wife infinitely and yet admit that I value her life more than my own. How can such a comparison be logically coherent or analytically understood? By using set theory.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>To use set theory we need to establish the sets, note their divergent rate of progress, take the ratio, and this identifies relative preference. Notice this approach is importantly different than traditional WTP measurement yet we obtain relative preference at the end, which is useful economic information.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Example set: consider a bad which is likelihood of death.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>We have established that 100% likelihood has an unconstrained WTP of infinite to avoid this bad.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Now, consider that we are only dealing with a 1 in 11 million chance of death. Would we pay an infinite amount?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Probably not, as revealed by the fact that people often consume plane flights and <a href=\\\"https://curiosity.com/topics/how-do-people-survive-plane-crashes-curiosity/\\\">this is the chance of death from riding on a plane flight</a>. But we would pay something, as revealed by the fact that consumers prefer safer flights and cars, etc.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Let's say I would pay $100 to reduce my chance of death by 10% (so that it becomes 90% of 1 in 11 million) then I would pay another $100 to reduce the chance by another 10% (so it becomes 81% of 1 in 11 million), and so on. We can construct a function to describe this pattern of demand: Chance of Death = (1/(11M))*.9^(WTP/100)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Maybe review those <a href=\\\"http://www.purplemath.com/modules/logrules.htm\\\">log rules</a> as we continue.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Therefore, ln(Chance of Death) = ln((1/(11M))*.9^(WTP/100)) = ln((1/(11M)) + (WTP/100)*ln(.9)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Therefore, [ln(Chance of Death) - ln((1/(11M))]*100/ln(.9) = WTP</li>\\r\\n \t<li>So, it's ugly but we got a WTP function. Now, consider that I would pay double for my wife's safety. The long and short is we get a similar function: [ln(Chance of Death) - ln((1/(11M))]*200/ln(.9)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>We can take the ratio WTP(me)/WTP(wifey) = 1/2. We just got a relative preference for comparing infinite value of lives. #mindblown.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>I don't think this info can be obtained using traditional cost-benefit or Kaldor-Hicks approaches. Many analysts who do cost of life evaluation opt for a revealed preference approach similar to some of what I did by comparing a person's willingness to buy a more or less safe car for example.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nIII. Issues in standard vs modified Kaldor-Hicks\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Standard Kaldor-Hicks says we should maximize social surplus. But the thing is, some people are douchebags. Why would I want to weight the preferences of murderers and pedophiles equally to my own? I can instead use a modified Kaldor-Hicks to maximize group-wise surplus.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>There are pros and cons to modified Kaldor-Hicks. Pro: I can exclude the douchebags and come up with a better analysis which incentivizes good behavior. Con: Someone has to decide who the douchebags are and what good behavior means, and maybe this decider ends up being the douchebag and the whole system is messed up bc a loser got elected to public office and is legislating what they think is good but which is in fact stupid. Not hypothetical. Happens all the time.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>I'm not sure I have the right answer but I would propose a few things:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Presuming we can get the proper moral code identified, modified Kaldor-Hicks seems better</li>\\r\\n \t<li>A central government w/ calculation problems, public choice malincentives, etc, probably won't identify the proper moral code.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>A polycentric market for law might be theoretically ideal to obtain the most efficient moral code, but we can't exactly implement such a market at the moment.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Perhaps as long as we are stuck with central government, standard Kaldor-Hicks is best for public policy</li>\\r\\n \t<li>At the micro level and in my own personal life, modified Kaldor-Hicks is certainly preferred. I don't want government regulating my moral code, but I definitely want to include my moral code in my considerations of my personal utility optimization.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

    "title": "BOA and Budgeting: Multi-Category Transactions",
    "date": "2017-03-26",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/bank-americas-new-budget-tool-cool/\\\">I recently bragged about</a> some major improvements Bank of America (BoA) has rolled out to their online platform which facilitate real budgeting. Even so, I noted some issues. This article provides a partial update, describes two new issues, and a strategy for obtaining bank data to create a superior external application. Such an external application would solve the noted issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>1 - The categories issue and an update</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my criticisms 0f BoA's app is their implementation of categories. I wasn't sure whether they forward-propagated user-provided matches between vendor and category. Now I'm sure they don't. I manually identified one vendor as a charitable organization when BoA had automatically marked it as uncategorized. That vendor receives a monthly payment which is still marked automatically marked as uncategorized until I manually reconcile it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother issue was the ability to make custom categories. The update here is that this:<img class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-6238 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/categories.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"707\\\" height=\\\"314\\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this feature previously existed and I simply didn't notice it. It allows you to create rules for automatically categorizing transactions by transaction description. It also allows the creation of new subcategories. A category might be transportation while a few subcategories might be gas, maintenance, and Uber payments.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-6239 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/categories-rules.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"992\\\" height=\\\"366\\\" />This is a bittersweet feature because BoA calculates cool panel data over time for categories, but not for subcategories. At the same time, this essentially allows a user to create any category and match it to any transaction, although you may have to stash your custom category as a subcategory of a category to which it is questionably related.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>2 - Two new issues</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two new issues are multi-category transactions and joint accounts. These two issues involve three features, including one called a virtual transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn obvious example of a multi-transaction category transaction is this: You go to a gas station and in the same transaction you buy some gas, some snacks, and some cash back for use later at the movie theater. BoA will log this as a gas station transaction and it will show up under transportation, but that accounting is not accurate and will harm your budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we need to do here is take the receipt and manually reconcile it as three virtual transactions. One for gas, one for good, and one for entertainment. Bank of America cannot do this. As covered in section 3, a standalone application could do this. A general principle here is that transaction-level budgeting isn't good enough. Budgets need to be at the level of the virtual transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a different case for multi-category transactions. In this case there really is one transaction, but while making a budget you might want to be able to query for different categories and have it show up either way. For example, you could create a Coffee Shop category and independently track how much you spend on coffee shops, but you also want this to show up under \\\"Going out to eat\\\" as well. In this case a single transaction should be able to obtain multiple categories. That is a separate feature but it's also related to multi-category transactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother issue is joint accounts. Bank of America and the US financial system elaborately handle formal joint accounts, but there is a use case for informal joint accounts while budgeting. These accounts are not legally binding, but you are able to pool incomes and expenditures from separate accounts for the purposes of a budget. BoA doesn't support this use case whatsoever. Specifically, consider my wife and I. We have 6 accounts: A shared checking account, each an independent checking account, and each a independent credit card account. Finally, a shared investment account which is external to Bank of America. When we budget we want to be able to see everything. This means pooling our independent check accounts for the budgets as well as the Betterment investment account.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it stands, Bank of America considers transfers to Betterment to be expenses when they are really just transfers. They are income-positive transfers once interest is considered. They are by no means an expense in the ordinary sense, although they are such in the formal accounting sense where it is an expense to one account and a credit to another; yet the latter part of the accounting is absent and throws off the budget. As it stands, Bank of America has no method of creating a budget overview which involves multiple BoA member accounts, and I don't know of a way to pool even a single user's multiple accounts. For example, a budget which sees my credit card, checking, and shared checking. Perhaps that's user error.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>3 - Data Extraction Strategy</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be brief, <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7269668/is-there-an-api-to-get-bank-transaction-and-bank-balance\\\">a scraper needs to be created</a>. This could be done with Node and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio\\\">Cheerio</a>. The data would need to be downloaded to your local machine. If you want to store it you should first encrypt the data unless you don't care about being hacked. (Not a joke; maybe you are a fan of transparent personal financial data. But you would be an exception.) I would personally encrypt my data and back it up using a private BitBucket account. Bank of America I think only stores your past 6 months, but handling the data yourself would allow much longer handling.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep an eye out because I may actually develop this tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we scrape Bank of America's transaction history we should do the following:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Create a GUI tool which allows all the previously discussed features: Virtual transactions, account joining, custom categories, data analytics by category, and so on.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>This could be facilitated by a small phone app or physical notebook which allows an individual to log transactions for later reconciliation by category. For example, when you make the multi-category transaction, jot it down and fix it later.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Careful on the analytics: If you went through a mortgage refinance two months ago and your monthly payment was reduced, you should budget on the reduced amount not the statistical average or prediction. This is called fundamental or structural analysis, and it is predictably better than regression in certain cases such as the one I just described. In other cases (eg you don't know the root cause and exact factor magnitudes for variation) then standard statistics is ideal.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Create an open vendor database where people can get crowd-sourced, best-practice, default transaction and vendor categories. This would be placed on GitHub in an SQL or JSON format.</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

The obvious problem is that the husband may want to leave the wife because she won't have sex with him, and such activity is making the problem worse. This issue is brushed off, not addressed.

What discussion of marriage and sex is really complete without discussions about children, religious values, and familial or community-wide reputation effects? The thesis that men have an incentive to leave a marriage during the middle years is neutralized by the fact that the wife, in a traditional marriage anyway, will have had one or more children and built up nurturing skill. Sure, the man could abandon the children as well as the wife, but this introduces severe religious and reputation issues, as well as a cost to social capital or other benefits to the father derived from the child in the future.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/260265?journalCode=jpe\\\">Becker, Gary S. 1974. “A Theory of Social Interactions.” Journal of Political Economy 82: 1063-1093.</a>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>3 Main Points\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Benevolence can be thought of as an economic parameterization of love.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Families maximize family income, and the family maximization function is equal to the utility function of the head of the household.

Alternatively, if there is a gain to be made by transferring property from the rotten kid to another family member, the head will incentivize (bribe) the rotten kid into doing so.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>What did Smith, Bentham, and Veblen conclude regarding envy and hatred?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Construed as a willingness to forego wealth in order to reduce the wealth of other people, Smith and Bentham dismissed the issue as minor and unsustainable.

For example, I might loan you money if I trust you to pay it back, and this has a real effect on the economy.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The theory of family utility maximization being equal to the maximization of the head is a great starting point and an interesting limiting case, but it seems to me that this is never perfectly obtained as real would-be heads are not perfectly beneficent toward their own families. Is my claim sound, and if so, what follows from it?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Does the Rotten Kid Theorem involve an interpersonal comparison of utility? Is this problematic? Does such maximization entail market prices and real wealth maximization, in contrast to utilitarian optimization? Would a Stupid Kid Problem, where an individual systematically under or overvalues wealth relative to the market, exist?</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/724349?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\\\">Cohen, Lloyd. 1987. “Marriage, Divorce, and Quasi Rents; Or, ‘I Gave Him the Best Years of My Life.’” Journal of Legal Studies 16: 267-303</a>.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>3 Main Points\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>In general the marriage market value of a woman declines with time more rapidly than does the value of a man.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Associated with the change from fault-basis divorce to no fault divorce was a change in the divorce rate from 1.4% to 6.2% over the period from 1940 to 1980.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>In a commercial contract the uncompensated breach by one party will result in the breaching party capturing the other's rents.

He seems to dismiss the objection on the grounds that men and women demand different roles and the stay at home nature of the divorcee does not subtract from her wife value in the same sense that it detracts from her professional value.

Seems like a good joke.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The author claims empirical identification problems in the remarriage market, but the metric seems obvious to me: Average time to remarriage. Moreover, he says that neither the prospective bride nor the prospective spouse carries a price tag, but wealth and income seem obvious proxies which are everywhere else leveraged by economists for that end.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Cohen's life-cycle description of the value of men and woman on the marriage market, as illustrated in Figure 1, runs counter to <em>Sex, Property Rights, and Divorce</em> both in the general content of the comparative value analysis and also in the particular case of strategic age choice. See Figures 1 and 2 from the latter paper as well. The former paper identifies men choosing younger women as a strategic solution while the latter identifies it as a problem.

Love, however, can complicate the picture.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If love is fleeting or the resolution of agents’ income uncertainty occurs predominantly later in life, then marriages with good economic matches last longer. In contrast, if love is persistent and the resolution of uncertainty to agents’ income occurs early, then marriages with good economic matches are more likely to be caught short with too little love to save a marriage. Consequently, once married, the partners will be more likely to divorce.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>3 Key Q&amp;As\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Under what conditions are two individuals less likely to marry?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Proposition 1.

Sex per se is not a homogenous good; of key importance is the role of religion which identifies ordinary sex and purchased sex as bads, but marital sex as good.

His findings are consistent with his theory, but they are also consistent with an emergent rather than strategic result.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The author finds that formal institutional weakness (WDI) positively interacts with ethnic diversity.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Social groups may choose fertility in some sense by selecting a group norm which creates an incentive for households to coordinate toward the desired social level of fertility. Actually, reverse causality seems more likely to me, but the author ignores that possibility. In either case, evidence for the existence of group fertility norms is given through a case study in exiled Tibetans.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>3 Key Q&amp;As\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>What two reasons to affirm the thesis are given in the introduction?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Individuals in diverse societies tend to vote for co-ethnic political candidates. Second, if ethnic groups allocate society's resources via conflict or bargaining in the shadow of conflict, then fertility might increase their combat strength.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>What are some of the significant determinants of fertility identified and their directions?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Positive: Diversity, the interaction of diversity and institutional weakness, internet access, and the constant.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Negative: improved water, the cultures of eastern Europe and Asia, the interaction of diversity and Democracy, and political instability.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Personal Notes\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>The author identifies the effect of diversity on fertility, but even if no such effect is found the strategic behavior may be there at the group level. That is, the major ethnicity may be fertility-complacent while the minorities are fertility-positive. Instead of measuring social fertility I think a better metric would be fertility among minorities or the ratio of minority to majority ethnicity fertility. I completely buy that minorities have higher fertility rates, although I don't really buy strategic political behavior as the motive. My reason for buying the fertility rate thing is just the data that the thing happens, but I'm not convinced it is strategic rather than emergent.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The author claims that redistributive gains to fertility should mainly be present where weak institutions erode property rights. Using World Bank's WDI as a metric specifically requires a pure formalist approach to institutions, which all good institutional analysts understand to be the shittier model of institutions (by tautology, of course).\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Formal institutions have no legs apart from informal ones: Informal institutions are all that actually matter. Analysis of formal institutions, such as the written law, often leads to dramatically misleading conclusions when compared to the way society in fact values or behaves at any given time.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>My alternative: Weak formal institutions are associated with stronger, not weaker, property rights. If we are talking generally about institutions, including informal institutions like norms, the only valid concept of weak institutions is <a href=\\\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/10/superforecastin.html\\\">general perpetual beta</a>, since an institution in this (better) framework is any collection of beliefs, and the lack of such things indicates a general lack of firmly held beliefs. Because general perpetual beta would be associated with higher social forecasting, it would seem to be that social strategic behavior would become more obvious and thereby more likely to undergo attenuation in such context.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Does the correlation with IW give evidence to the possibility of a correlation with informal institutions or are these independent factors? Are strong informal institutions plausibly positively associated with strategic social behavior? Granted, I would expect an attenuated coefficient as per 3.2.2, but not attenuation to 0.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The robustness checks look like crap to me. There is no long model which includes all of the significant factors. It looks like internet is a key factor, it has a huge cross-correlative influence on the factor of interest, and it is only assessed in one model. This, coupled with the enormous size of the target data set and the few factors assessed within that data set, provide some reason to worry whether factor selection has been exposed to a selection bias rather than an exhaustive and conclusive critical analysis.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.peterleeson.com/Wife_Sales.pdf\\\">[PDF] Leeson, Peter T., Peter J.

In Wife Sales divorce was only allowed by an act of Parliament, then it became easier through a wife sale, later it was allowed in the US with fault, and finally no fault divorce became a thing.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Leeson: It also relates to the Cohen paper in that the Wife Sales paper sees women as a driver of divorce, but the Cohen paper sees middle aged men as a driver of divorce, as well as women during other periods in the marriage life-cycle.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Me: The Wife Sales paper also relates to the Janus paper on this question of formal vs informal property rights and institutions. The Wife Sale was an informal institution and women exhibited informal property rights through these sales, but the Janus paper conducts a formal institutional analysis using World Bank info.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Why do people get married? Why not just have a Civil Union or live together, perhaps even taking on a religious marriage, without wanting the State's paper record of marriage?\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>2 kinds of marriage: Traditional/religious marriage and state-recognized marriage.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>In any case it seems to be a combination of <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/politics-and-government/caplan-notes-329-pub-choice-ii/\\\">expressive and instrumental value</a>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Reasons for traditional marriage:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>God-approved vehicle for sex</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Moral signaling</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Reasons for legal marriage:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>There are some legal advantages, but terribly few which aren't also gained under civil union.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Second-best moral signaling: A way for non-Christians to claim moral status when the Christian church won't directly give such validation. Eg, gay marriage and atheists getting married may feel validated by a state-backed marriage certificate.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>There may be something to the idea of the state as a trustworthy records keeper. A man may claim he's not married but truly be married. In older times there was essentially one Roman Catholic church who could perform this records keeping, but these days the man may have been married in some small denomination and go off to be married under a new denomination, so the denominations may not be able to validate marital status as well as the state.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Here's a weird problem related to #3. I have a friend who got married and now wants a divorce, but the wife won't grant it without taking half of his stuff. So he isn't getting divorced but their separated and there's another girl he would marry if he could. In this weird situation it seems like the state is effectively blocking divorce in a case where denominations would be powerless to block him.

    "title": "A Simple Argument for Objective Value",
    "date": "2017-04-05",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "I'm an economist. I'm studying at GMU, a university known for carrying on the Austrian tradition. While all economists recognize subjectivism, variously understood, I've talked about how <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/review-subjectivism-economics/\\\">Austrians are particularly extreme subjectivists and dubious of objective value</a>. This article presents a simple economic argument for objective value.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent Leeson class was typical. A discussion of marriage rose <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/non-market-decision-making-reading-notes-section-3-7/\\\">central to a discussion on the family</a>. Much of the class seemed perplexed about the demand for marriage despite various alternatives, but it seemed obvious to me that religion was the cause. The existence of religion, in turn, seemed to perplex many in the class. How could a bunch of lies be efficient? Isn't truth efficient? Creative theories were put forth but the obvious argument was danced around like a pink elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, my obvious argument for the durability of religion, from which the durability of marriage follows, and which is trivially turned into a general argument for objective value:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Truth is durable and efficient</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Christianity is true</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Therefore, Christianity (and Christian marriage) are durable and efficient</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nA weaker form:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Credibility has value</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Some religions with positive credibility exist</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Therefore, some religions have value</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThe key here is that truth is objective. Credibility, a weaker metric, is subjective, but it is a function of truth. Therefore, it is in part objectively determined. If we see credibility as a product and truth as one of the factors of production, the value attributed to truth as an input may be called objective value. Interestingly, technology may be considered a gain to true knowledge, which in turn provides a measure of the value of truth. This highlights a point about search theory which I have long emphasized: The content of the information produced is important. Large quantities of information may not be beneficial is the information is systematically false. True information has positive value. The fact that people spend so much on search in order to obtain truth shows, as a third example, the value of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/experimental-identification-preference-effect/\\\">Here is an article</a> I did to empirically establish the theoretically obvious claim that a change to the information stock of an individual may explains shifts in willingness to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do believe in objective value writ large. What I mean by that is that I believe the efficient society is allocated and operates according to the will of God. I argue against theocracy, but toward a polycentric legal system coupled with a Christian culture. Under this view, objective moral values* may be seen as beneficial institutions or moral capital, and a straightforward prediction is that societies rich in such capital are expected correlate with higher real productivity and utilitarian social surplus. I see evidence for this which I won't thoroughly review, but it is worth noting that at the macro level many associate western development with the institution of Christianity, and at the micro level we see people who attend church are markedly more satisfied with their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Such as the suppression of adultery, murder, and thievery, as well as the support of love, truth, and charity, among much else.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the broader set of claims just identified are difficult to concisely review, test, and validate, this article concerns a small subset of two kinds of objective value. Real or nominal prices are objective measures of value. Two kinds of objective value are:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>The value of truth</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Equilibrium values</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThree approaches to the estimation of the value of truth were previously suggested:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Demand for religious services\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>A positive analysis could take various scriptures and count the number or density of true, false, and unverifiable claims, or some combination of those and other factors, and attempt to output demand. This would be a straightforward regression of value on estimated truth.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Alternatively, we could measure demand as a function of credibility, where credibility in turn is taken as a function of truth. Credibility could be measured by survey.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Demand for search</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The value of technology\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Willingness to pay for new technology, eg R&amp;D investment</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The revenue product of technology. Marginal revenue product would give you the economic value of some particular set of statements, those true claims which constitute the delta between the old technology and the new technology, where a technology is a set of knowledge, and knowledge is a known true claim. Total revenue product would give you the economic value of a very large set of knowledge, but this is ultimately still an objective value of truth.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nNotice that ultimately all production depends on some technology. Consequently, all production is ultimately dependent on truth and all value is in some sense objective. This is my counter to those who would say all value is ultimately subjective:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>It is not ultimately subjective because subjective evaluation depends on prior or contemporaneous objective truth.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If it is ultimately subjective, it is simultaneously ultimately objective. It is ultimately and irreducibly both. One deserves no more attention than the other.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Similarly, in empirical work they both matter. Technical productivity is a real I/O measure and thereby objective, but market research on people's expectations, opinions, and willingness to pay matter equally. There really is no sense in which running a business doesn't need both considerations.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Some evidence suggests that free will is an illusion and the world is entirely deterministic. Supposing free will exists it may be pinched, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem\\\">squeezed</a>, or rigged, such that <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/sye-and-election/\\\">in the long run the world turns out to be deterministic</a>.

    "title": "Against Externalities",
    "date": "2017-04-27",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "I have previously written quite a bit against claims about externalities. This article collects those points in one place and adds a bit more info.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Older Points</strong>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/social-costs-market-costs/\\\">Social Costs = Market Costs, Sept 2014</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/defending-coase-thereom-attacking-externality-justification-intrusion/\\\">Defending the Coase Thereom, Attacking Externality Justification for Intrusion, Sept 2014</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/gruber-free-riders-political-economy/\\\">On Gruber, Free Riders, and Political Economy, Sept 2014</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/john-vandivier-comments-1112-readings/\\\">John Vandivier Comments for 11/12 Readings, Nov 2014</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/possible-mechanism-market-self-regulation/\\\">A Possible Mechanism for Market Self-Regulation, Nov 2014</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<strong>Additional Points</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nI propose a rule of thumb in economic policy: The error of an analytical approach is measurable by the share of external effects it identifies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a useful heuristic based on my deeper assertion that externalities don't actually exist. Apparent externalities are manifestations of analytical error. I argue that externalities don't exist based on the older articles and a few additional points:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Empirically, low quality studies including obviously slanted CBAs typically identify large external effects to motivate intervention. High quality studies find small external effects, include comparative analysis, find that external effects are smaller than transaction costs, or find that external effects were internalized all along.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Go see a CBAs delivered to any US State Department of Transportation, for example. Opportunity costs, such as benefits from privatization, are generally excluded. Inflation is often ignored. Project costs and maintenance costs are understated, the completion schedules are optimistic, congestion benefits to the public and revenue (in the case of toll roads) are overstated as would be expected in a public choice perspective.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>David Friedman vs Climate Scientists on externalities from global warming are a great example. \\\"The sky is falling!\\\" vs \\\"Actually, this could be good for the economy.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Logically, there is no distinction between a positive and a negative externality other than the opinion of the analyst. Free riders and hold out problems are examples of negative externalities, right? Wrong. A free rider is a slur for someone who enjoys a positive externality. The hold out problem is a scape goat for utility-optimizing investment/gambling based on subjective value.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The best argument against me is perhaps Caplan's externality from murder argument.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>His example is as follows: Person A hires person B to kill person C. A and B are better off, but clearly C is worse off right? I grant this point, but I see several problems in saying this demonstrates an externality problem on the market:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>This is not how normal external cost analysis proceeds. Normal external cost anlysis would ask whether society is better or worse off, not whether some person is better or worse off. If society is better off with C dead we would not see an externality under a standard analysis.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>In fact, one could argue society is worse off with C alive. Maybe C is a mass murder. But I argue neither. I argue a well-formed market would have externalities in neither direction because the concept is erroneous.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>It is not clear that C was not involved in this transaction why would A want C dead? It seems to me the analysis ignores some prior provocation. It seems to me that the inclusion of this provocation would eliminate the existance of an externality.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Consider historical cases as in point 4 for evidence to my point. I consider this like a Newton's First Law of Economics. Caplan might say \\\"some people are crazy enough to pay something to kill someone for no reason.\\\" I doubt it. A small reason? Yes. No reason? No. And it's the efficiency of the market definition of \\\"small\\\" which makes the market &gt; government here.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>There is no comparative inefficiency if the market handles the situation better than the government would. Caplan is famous for his employment of this rule, but he dodges his own standard here. The alternative to deregulated assassination is government regulated assassination. Typical public choice arguments afflict the latter.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>In a situation of futarchy, an assassination market would be created by \\\"predicting\\\" the death of A on some date. It becomes a motive for assassination because a predictor can endogenously gain by causing the death of A on said date. <a href=\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/11/18/meet-the-assassination-market-creator-whos-crowdfunding-murder-with-bitcoins/#3d9b05823d9b\\\">This historically occurred in an underground Bitcoin-denominated assassination market</a>. Bernanke had a hit on him for something like 1.2 Million USD at some point in time.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Why call this inefficient? Immoral, I agree, but in a GDP, GDP growth, or Kaldor-Hicks sense the deregulation of this market is a clear gain to efficiency and welfare.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>In a situation of futarchy, if C was innocent then the market would protect him. The assassination would never be profitable. Imo, this is the final blow to the Caplan defense of murder regulation on economic grounds; I admit if he is going to make a moral argument then a whole series of other considerations must be made and he is in fact likely to win. If C is assassinated under futarchy he is guilty by the standard of the most efficient calculation machine; the market. Far better than a typical jury system, etc.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Given my theory that moral and economic efficiency are in harmony, how can I reconcile that Caplan has a moral point but not an economic point? My typical response in the case of gay marriage, abortion, drug use, and all other sort of objectionable activity from my perspective: People should be allowed to do it, they just shouldn't actually do it. (Eg hire hitmen in this case.)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Permissionless innovation tho.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Interestingly, Caplan and Hanson succumbed to this argument and suggested regulatory futarchy to neutralize this effect. <a href=\\\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e854/pc12.htm\\\">\\\"Register the bettors, and/or cap the bets.\\\"</a></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nMaybe it would clear things a bit to restate what I have already said in the fashion I said it on Facebook:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) I feel like low quality studies find large externalities and high quality studies often notice that the market was internalizing optimally all along.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) I think a credible argument can be made that there are no real things called externalities, both in theory and in reality. Instead, apparent externalities arise from incorrectly identifying contracts and products.\\r\\n\\r\\nInteresting extra info: Caplan's \\\"externality from murder\\\" is perhaps the most clear cut case against me, but there I see a missing presupposition. Why would anyone kill another? There is likely some prior provocation being ignored. A Newton's First Law of Economics if you will. Similarly, I think an innocent would be protected on an assassination market.",

    "title": "Identifying Key Papers in the Economics of Education",
    "date": "2017-05-01",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article documents how I went about identifying key papers as a starting point in researching the economics of education.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Motivation</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Approach</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Results</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Motivation</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, let me give some motivation and background. I'm in the early stages of dissertation writing and my primary interest is in the economics of education. In particular, I am interested in alternative credentials, but I am attempting to broaden to education in general because I have had a tough time locating data for alternative credentials. I have also been encouraged by others to publish on certain more traditional topics including the use of vouchers. I think it's important to listen to others during research. I don't buy the lone scholar approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an economist, I am looking for ways to improve education outcomes. This may mean increasing investment where the ROI is positive, and it may mean implementing austerity to combat waste. In determining ROI, I need to investigate the education literature to come up with reasonable measures of education and factors of performance among other things. I seek common approaches, measures, and conclusions. I also seek open questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Approach</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nMy initial approach was to create 5 categories of interesting papers, and attempt to find at least 5 papers in each category. This results in a first-pass goal of 25 papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the categories:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Recent papers in top journals of education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Highly regarded education papers, in terms of cites/year, regardless of journal or time</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Recent papers in top economics journals regarding education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Highly regarded papers in the economics of education, in terms of cites/year, regardless of journal or time</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Highly regarded papers on the psychology of learning and education, in terms of cites/year, regardless of journal or time</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nFirst I do a bit of research to identify the top journals of interest. This is discussed in the results section. The journal research happens first to yield some keywords with which I can conduct a Google Scholar query using Harzing's Publish or Perish. The query identifies the highly regarded papers in terms of citations. After some journals were identified, I looked over their recent articles in the following way:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Scan the titles of each published article in the 3 most recent publications</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If the title caught my eye, read the abstract</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Read a minimum of 3 abstracts per journal</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If the abstract has my interest, quickly scan the article.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If it still looks interesting, add it to my list of interesting articles. Add a brief note about why I liked it.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nAfter that I proceed to use Harzing's Publish or Perish to identify the other articles. Overall, here's what I'm looking for in the papers:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Keywords</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Author names</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Research designs</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Open and closed questions</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Interesting prior papers, via citations. In particular, citations in common</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Evidence related to my current questions\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Economics of alternative credentials</li>\\r\\n \t<li>An ABM of voucher efficacy</li>\\r\\n \t<li>An ABM of higher education enrollment and graduation</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Methods of improving student and teacher performance. In particular, malleability of traits or behaviors.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>For example, can we train students and teachers to be gritty and conscientious?</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Results</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile performing the research, I obtained far more than 25 papers. As a result, I only identify the interesting journals in this section.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/economics-education-reviewing-content-key-papers/\\\">See this article</a> for the list of specific and interesting articles found, as well as brief notes about why each item was considered interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to <a href=\\\"http://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=3304\\\">Scimago Journal Rankings for Education</a>, these are the top 10 journals in education:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Engineering Education (SJR indicator = 6.18)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>American Educational Research Journal</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Research in Science Teaching</li>\\r\\n \t<li>American Journal of Education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Internet and Higher Education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Review of Educational Research</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of the Learning Sciences</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Teacher Education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Computers and Education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Child Development (SJR indicator = 3.08)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nAlso of interest is #12, which deals directly with questions of education policy: <em>Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the top 5 <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_journal\\\">open access journals</a>:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Education Policy (SJR indicator = 2.36)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Practical Assessment, Research and Evaluation</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Medical Education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Educational Technology Research and Development</li>\\r\\n \t<li>International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning (SJR indicator = 1.35)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nFrom this pool of journals, I identified these of interest to me:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Engineering Education\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Although I don't care about engineering, the rank and SJR indicators are so high I want to take a look.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>American Educational Research Journal</li>\\r\\n \t<li>American Journal of Education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Internet and Higher Education\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Because of my special interest in alternative credentials.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Review of Educational Research</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of the Learning Sciences</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Child Development\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Because cognitive development is known to play a special role in education.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Education Policy</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Educational Technology Research and Development</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nI didn't find any interesting open access journals in economics, but here are the top 10 economics journals:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Quarterly Journal of Economics</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Finance</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Econometrica</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Review of Financial Studies</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Financial Economics</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Economic Literature</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Review of Economic Studies</li>\\r\\n \t<li>American Economic Journal: Applied Economics</li>\\r\\n \t<li>American Economic Review</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Journal of Political Economy</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nBecause my interest is not finance, I want to exclude the <em>Review of Financial Studies </em>and <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll include the <em>Journal of Finance</em> due to it's high rank.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo other journals of interest, bringing the total to 10, include #17, <em>American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics </em>and #19, <em>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is a list of 20 interesting journals.

    "content": "This article argues in favor of moderate literalism as an ideal mode for reading the Bible. I compare it to two other modes. I also discuss a concept called methodological plausibility which can be used outside of religion as a general thinking tool. Disclaimer: I'm not a trained theologian.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Moderate Literalism:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>The Bible is true in expectation (any given statement is expected to be sufficiently true.)\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>The Bible is \\\"God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness\\\" <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm\\\">just as it claims to be</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li>This approach is compatible with but does not require Biblical Inerrency\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Even in the face of possible errors (for any reason from reader error to translation error to scribe error or whatever) this approach still holds for any given portion of the Bible to be <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">true in expectation</span> even if it is not <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">true with certainty</span>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>To be fair, I don't know of any demonstrably false claims in the Bible (<a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A13-19\\\">Bats are birds</a>? <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm\\\">PI = 3</a>? Language differences and rounding, these are not errors.)</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Considers certain parts of the Bible literal and others not, appropriately:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>When the Bible says something is a parable, it need not be literal</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The Psalms, as poetry, need not be literal</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Is open to the possibility of (not certain of the reality of) <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_genre&amp;oldid=769177897\\\">historical genre</a>. Eg the Old Testament, including Genesis.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Eg it is open to the possibility of YEC, but considers it methodologically implausible compared to OEC. (This is different from claiming either with certainty.)</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Considers the Gospels literal (again, except where there is obvious use of parable or simile)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Overall, literal in expectation but not with certainty.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Considers sufficiency the key to the Gospel, not the totality of truth.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm\\\">The Bible implies a circle has a circumference equal to 3 times its diameter</a>. This is \\\"true enough\\\" as it is a rounding of pi, or an approximation. An exact statement of pi would be impossible. That would be the exact/perfect/total truth, but pi is irrational and can't be exhaustively defined. It's irrelevant to the key point(s) of scripture anyway.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The following does not tell us everything about God (that would be infinite in length and incomprehensible anyway) but it is sufficient for salvation: \\\"<a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm\\\">For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life</a>.\\\"</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Hyperliteralism\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Not just literal but overly literal, leading to internally inconsistent (and perhaps externally invalid) theological claims.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>May be tightly bound to a single translation and fail to realize the possibility that the original language is an inexact match, may be a component of an idiom, may have a different cultural meaning, may be used poetically, and so on.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Examples:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>\\\"<a href=\\\"http://creation.com/2-peter-38-one-day-is-like-a-thousand-years\\\">With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day</a>\\\" is interpreted as \\\"Whenever the Bible says God did something in a day, it actually means he did it in exactly 1000 years.\\\"</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The Earth (and universe?) including all life was created in 6 adjacent periods of 24 hours. (Note that this contradicts the above point, which itself is based on an overly literal reading of scripture.)</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Overabstraction / Theological Liberalism / Theological Progressivism\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Under the extreme form, there is no specific set of beliefs identified as Christianity.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Any particular statement might be literal or non-literal. There is a selection problem as such Christians are not fully coordinated about what is and isn't literal.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Jesus might not literally be divine or have literally resurrected. Hell might not literally exist. Salvation might not literally exist. Mary may not have actually been a virgin. God might be a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism\\\">clock-maker</a>, an abstract concept leading to moral guidelines, or a natural force like physics instead of an intelligent agent.</li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.esv.org/Revelation+22:15;1+Corinthians+6:9-10;Galatians+5:19-21;Ephesians+5:5;1+Timothy+1:9;Hebrews+12:14/\\\">1 Corinthians 6:9 and related scripture</a> which says homosexuals won't go to heaven (when read in a moderately literal way) might \\\"not really mean that\\\" for one reason or another.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>There isn't much difference between an extremely liberal such Christian and, say, and atheist.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The reasons a verse might be considered non-literal are ad infinitum and a bit ad hoc. Often a result of a misapplication of good hermeneutic rather than obviously bad hermeneutic.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>A common appeal is metaphor or poetic language.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>The issue is when these are misapplied. Psalms is a collection of songs and validly understood to be poetic. Claiming a passage from the Gospels to be poetic is an implausible application of poetic language.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Another issue is \\\"reading between the lines.\\\" In this case theology is put above the straightforward reading of the Bible. A common example is the \\\"deeper meaning\\\" hermeneutic.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Eg <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm\\\">Jesus said to even hate a man is as bad as murder</a>, and so on with the other sins. Every physical action has a \\\"deeper sin\\\" which is rooted in motivation (so far I agree, but the next sentence is where I have an issue). So, even if a person physically does something bad, as long as their heart is in the right place it's OK.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Consider the following: \\\"An active and unrepentant homosexual is still a Christian and can go to heaven as long as they claim Jesus as their savior.\\\"</li>\\r\\n \t<li>I would consider the above claim methodologically implausible (see the next section for a thorough definition) based on a moderately literal reading of the Bible. That is, I'm not certain it's false, but I do expect it to be false.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Differences in historical context are another way in which a straightforward reading might be wrong. This one is quite effective because it is often used correctly (and then sometimes not). That is, X meant something different in Biblical times compared to today.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Correct usage: Slavery in the Bible is not terribly comparable to American slavery. For example, Biblical slavery was often (usually? idk) a voluntary arrangement.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Incorrect usage (imho): Homosexuality being condemned in the Bible doesn't mean it's a sin today.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nOne theological problem is that we can't just say \\\"the buck stops here\\\" with me as an individual. The Bible <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm\\\">does not say God is there \\\"wherever one is gathered in my name.\\\"</a> The church is the body of Christ and the collection of believers. So we might want to be super mainstream Christians, but at the same time the Bible emphasizes that many non-Christians will claim to be Christians (<a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A21-23&amp;version=NIV\\\">Matthew</a>, <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/luke/13-24.htm\\\">Luke</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A13-14&amp;version=NIV\\\">different Matthew</a>). What I'm curious about is whether the latter passage in Matthew means many (but not most) people who claim are not Scotsman, or whether it means many (indeed, most) people who claim to be Christian are not so. This would roughly inform the question: How radical should we be willing to get with our theology?\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Methodological Plausibility</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis practice results in rigorous expectations about claims, even when reproducible empirical data is unavailable:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Something which is methodologically plausible is true in expectation, but not with certainty.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Something which is methodologically implausible is false in expectation, but not with certainty.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Something is objectively implausible if, according to certain suppositions, it is logically unlikely. It may be strictly unlikely (&lt; 50% chance) or relatively unlikely (some other explanation with a  higher chance).</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Claims may be separately considered operationally probable or logically probable.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>A coin toss if 50% operationally probable. (It is also 50% logically probable).</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Young Earth Creationism is not operationally verifiable. It is not empirically verifiable. The operational probability is unknown, but we can still assess the logical validity of the concept.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Methodological Plausibility is a standardized and rigorous approach to logical analysis of concepts. The approach is most useful when the operational validity of some claim cannot be measured.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The logical probability (especially the comparative logical probability of multiple claims) can be assessed as follows:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Suppose a definite set of criteria.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Choose a \\\"winner\\\" for each item of criteria.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The most frequent winner is the most logically plausible. It is logically likely. It's logical likelihood is mathematically measurable as the fraction of wins in the context of a particular set of criteria.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>As an example:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Young Earth Creationism is empirically unverifiable and internally inconsistent.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Old Earth Creationism is empirically plausible and internally consistent (at least plausibly so if not perfectly so, and certainly comparatively so).</li>\\r\\n \t<li>So Old Earth Creationism \\\"wins\\\" 2/2 criteria competitions. It is logically more likely to be true, given the particular set of criteria.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>However is it <em>actually or empirically</em> more likely? No, because YEC can't be measured, at least not without a time machine.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>A time machine might be invented and some dude could go back and observe that YEC is actually / empirically / functionally / operationally true.\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>This would show that is it actually true despite being comparatively unlikely or false <em>in expectation</em>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>YEC would in that case be true <em>despite</em> the bad arguments for in, not with such arguments.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>",

    "title": "Defending Iterative Christianity",
    "date": "2017-08-01",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "There are two goals within the Church:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>To produce the highest quality Christians\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>In terms of theological and practical perfection (sanctification / holiness)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>To produce the highest quantity of Christians\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>That is, to bring as many people to salvation as possible.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>This involves defining a minimal definition of Christianity, which Lewis does in a standard way under Mere Christianity.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThese goals sometimes apparently collide, but I argue this apparent collision is in fact a complimentary interaction of two important processes, rather than a problem to be addressed through the preference of one approach over the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collision is stereotypically the case of of a theological perfectionist attacking an evangelist. The evangelist uses basic argumentation which may not be theologically rich to optimize on the effectiveness of communication and the chance of conversion. The perfectionist claims this process foregoes important theology which may result either in acute or longer term problems for the Church or the individual receiving evangelical messaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a caricature we can think of Dr. James White attacking Dr. William Lane Craig. This is a caricature because I'm not sure such a direct attack has ever taken place, I'm not sure Craig exactly optimizes on quantity, and I'm not sure White exactly optimizes on quality, but the point remains more or less. White has certainly criticized particular statements from Craig but I'm not sure how general or serious any of that is.\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig will use a relatively uncontroversial but theologically minimal argument, such as the Kalam Cosmological Argument, to produce a highly defensible claim to the validity of Christianity over atheism, but he does not make much of an attempt, at least in the context of his time-constrained public debates, to train up his converts in a theologically rich way. White gets theologically deep but he is hardly optimizing on mass appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I want to claim is that both of these guys are awesome, and both of their roles are needed in the Church. I want to claim that the approach of some folks specializing in conversion then handing off for training to others is an economically appealing approach to Christian Economy. I want to say it's OK for someone to begin as an atheist, become a Mere Christian, and engage in an ongoing process of iterative improvement, the end of which may never be obtained. I want to make this argument in a rigorous way, and rebuff those who might claim that the Mere Christian evangelical approach isn't good enough. The argument goes this way:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Making a true claim is never morally wrong.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>At least one theologically dry argument is true.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Therefore, theologically dry evangelism is not strictly wrong.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Elaborating on point 1</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes making true claims is inconvenient for some folks, of course, but it doesn't follow that 1 is invalid. White lies, for example, may be convenient but they are not logically morally permissible. Consider that anyone who attacks claim 1 is proclaiming the negation of 1. That is, they are saying that it's OK to lie at least some of the time. How can any argument made by such an individual be considered trustworthy?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most credible critique a theological perfectionist can make falls in this domain. The key in establishing the validity of my argument is to recognize that the claim, as I will outline below, however interesting, does not entail a rejection of point 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we will see while elaborating point 2, partial truth does not entail non-truth, and to argue that the ilk of Craig are malicious is absurd, but one might argue that a person converted on the grounds of a theologically weak argument is set up more or less to abandon the faith when and if the theologically weak argument is defeated. This claim is not necessarily false, it's just implausible to make credibly. Moreover, it doesn't entail a rejection of 1. To say that there is some other course of action, B, which may be preferable to the course of action taken, A, does not entail that A is morally wrong. It simply indicates the need for further training of the converted and also points to the adoption of B. As someone who studies economics, this is reflective of opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is taken as bad in economics, but is this a moral bad? My view on this interesting point is that the execution of B would constitute a moral improvement, but it does not follow that the execution of A is morally bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is one reason for which I prefer the scriptural view of morality to the economic view of morality. Scripture establishes a set of morally sufficient actions, a rather large set in fact, even while recognizing that some of those actions within the permissible set are indeed better than others. In contrast, it may be argued that economic analysis entails some action is optimal and anything less is bad. It's worth noting that economic analysis is often flawed and realistic analysis is rife with multiple equilibria.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Opportunity Cost view of Morality to entail a rejection of point 1, the following would have to be demonstrated:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Suboptimal action is immoral in principle</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Optimal action is not only in the feasible set, but MB &gt; MC, adjusted for risk\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Is investing to identify a better method of evangelism more valuable then doing another round of evangelism using the current process?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If Craig changes his routine, the point-estimate may improve but will it not also increase the risk of a bad performance?</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The effect of the alternative action can be reliably known\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>If Craig addressed the audience differently, can you really be sure Jim wouldn't deconvert 6 months later?</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The improvement must be important.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Any improvement to salvation is extremely important. I'm not arguing \\\"Jim deconverting 6 months vs 7 months isn't important.\\\" I think that would be important.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>What I'm really suggesting is that the framework of analysis has some error, so B is only identified as better than A with some degree of confidence less than 100%. The improvement must be large enough such that the analytical error is credibly dominated by expected gains. That's what I mean by importance here. It's similar to the \\\"adjusted for risk\\\" part of #2, but here I'm referring to model error in particular, while over there I'm highlighting implementation risk.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Elaborating on point 2</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I am referring to a broad class of arguments including evidential, presuppositional, moral, ontological, and preference-oriented argumentation. Specific examples include Craig's Kalam Cosmological argument, various forms of the Moral Argument from Craig and others, the ontological argument from Plantiga et al, the argument from reason as elucidated by Lewis and also the form given by Bruggencate (also called the Transcendental Argument or TAG), the historical argument as put forth by many folks (I really like J Warner Wallace here), and Pascal's Wager as well as <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/odd-argument-belief-god-vandivierian-wager/\\\">my version of the wager</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese arguments, with some exception, focus on a narrow point of theology or even no theology at all to build a case for the existence of God, and sometimes further to the particular faith of Christianity. Together, they make a powerful cumulative argument for the faith, but even cumulatively they may be taken as theologically dry, minimal, or non-rich. This does nothing to undermine their truth content.\\r\\n\\r\\nA theological perfectionist might criticize points 1 or 2 by saying that a statement which is theologically non-rich does not proclaim the entire gospel and therefore it leaves some truth out. The claim might be made that partial truth amounts to non-truth. This line of argumentation is fallacious for a number of reasons:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Full truth is not always logically transferable.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>In particular under time constraint as is always the case, but particularly during evangelism or formal debate.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Consider attempting to precisely communicate the value of pi. It cannot be done as the value is irrational and never terminates.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>For scriptural backing, consider that the Bible attempts to communicate the value of pi by rounding, as it implies that the circumference of a circle is three times it's diameter.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+7%3A23-26\\\">In 1 Kings 7:23-26</a>. Some commentary <a href=\\\"http://www.purplemath.com/modules/bibleval.htm\\\">here</a>.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>The standard of salvation, according to scripture, is not perfect understanding of theology.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>In contrast, <a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3:16\\\">John 3:16</a> concisely describes the standard of who is a Christian. As it happens this is my favorite verse in the Bible.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Lewis elaborates in detail coining the term <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652926\\\">Mere Christianity</a>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>As a common sense appeal, Jesus and scripture writ large is generally seen as critical of the legalist tradition, including the Pharisees and the Judaizers.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>No one can comprehend the full truth of God. Scriptural backing, among other verses, include the concise <a href=\\\"http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-8.htm\\\">Isaiah 55:8</a> and the detailed <a href=\\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+8%3A16-17&amp;version=NCV\\\">Ecclesiastes 8:16-17</a>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Partial truth is not the same as non-truth.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>We do have to deal with the problem of manipulation or maliciousness, but that is technically another problem.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>To say that Joe drank the milk is not false, even if Jane asked Joe to drink the milk, so long as Joe did in fact drink the milk.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Elaborating on point 3</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe understated conclusion holds logically, but it's understated. I am really making a modest claim that at least one definite argument is true, but in fact I'd be surprised if nearly all of them aren't true. So technically I have proven that dry evangelism is not always bad, but non-technically I am providing a framework with which we can argue that dry evangelism is frequently good.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say dry evangelism is not strictly wrong in a modest sense. That is, it is not wrong per se or by necessity. Clearly, I make no claim that it is always preferred, or even usually preferred. Informally, I do think dry evangelism is often preferred in the case in which it actually used. I think theologically deep training is also usually preferred in the case where it is actually used. In some sense, I am arguing for the status quo.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to add something less formal and more general to the whole discussion which is not isolated to a particular point. I think iterative processes in general are highly efficient. I think specialization in labor is highly efficient. While efficiency per se is morally neutral, it has the ability to increase the output of any process for a given amount of input. It can therefore be seen as a moral multiplier on moral action. So I fall short of advocating more efficiency in every kind of human action, but I certainly advocate efficiency in the morally positive actions of the Church which include evangelism and further training of those who have already been converted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't think optimizing on quality is ideal. How many people would ever reach the goal, and where should the goal be placed? It would be placed at some level of perfectionist sufficiency which both still imperfect and also a standard of sufficiency other than the one set by scripture. After properly identifying the scripture-based level of sufficiency, which I think is consistent with Mere Christianity, I think it's entirely proper to try and improve quantity. So the equilibrium would have a mix of both.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm sure the mix of evangelism and teaching we see today is in some ways improvable, but how should we go about improving it? Most processes I see today, particularly in economics, IT, and business, define a process pipeline and collect metrics to optimize flow through that pipeline. I see no reason to avoid applying this framework to the Church as well, and I think individual status as a Mere Christian is a useful conversion target in the process.",

    "content": "Lauren Southern just released a video criticizing modern libertarianism. She's got some points, but imo they mostly apply to the modern libertarian movement and not libertarianism qua libertarianism as an intellectual thingy. This article points out my three issues with the latter, but I largely agree with her points as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI argue:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Anarcho-capitalists are too small a share of libertarians</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Anarcho-capitalism alone is improved on through the addition of Christianity</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Anarcho-capitalism + Christianity is better identified with conservatism than libertarianism.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>1 - Anarcho-capitalists are too small a share of libertarians</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does libertarianism mean to you? It means many things to many people, and there any many points of contradiction. We must take the points of agreement as the necessary substance of libertarianism. Some of the most agreed upon definitions include:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libertarianism&amp;oldid=799696258\\\">Wikipedia</a> - A collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Dictionary.com - An extreme laissez-faire political philosophy advocating only minimal state intervention in the lives of citizens.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Adherence to the NAP</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nNotice that the above definitions involve a minimally-sized state. The problem here is that libertarians do not agree on the minimal size. Why do we need a government at all? The main reason given is to provide for the safety and rights of the people. Yet, this line of thinking is identical to the thoughts of liberals and conservatives of all stripes. Moreover, the set of defensible rights is disagreed on. Moreover, safety can only exist where harm or aggression has a meaningful identify, but the definition of coercion is not agreed on by libertarians.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoercion problems include:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>How do we distinguish the use of force from coercion in theory?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>How do we distinguish the use of force from coercion in practice?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>How do we reconcile that coercion as usually defined sometimes leads to efficient or morally preferred outcomes?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Is verbal abuse coercion?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Should parents be able to coerce their children?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Given that some violence is committed, what degree of violence is allowable as punishment?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Will the market not thrive even in the presence of coercion?</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThe full employment of the free market is called anarcho-capitalism. There are two main approaches to anarcho-capitalism. The approach put forth by Rothbard and the approach put forth by David Friedman. Adherents to either approach constitute a very small segment of libertarianism. I could go on about how Friedman's version is preferred and Rothbard is full of error, but it's already a problem for libertarianism that most libertarians reject both.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>2 - Anarcho-capitalism alone is improved on through the addition of Christianity</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nAn individual can be a positive or normative anarcho-capitalist. The normative grounding for anarcho-capitalism fails:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>The usual approach to efficiency calculations in economics is non-normative</li>\\r\\n \t<li>To claim that efficiency is a moral good is both without grounding and plainly false\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>For example, Kaldor-Hicks Efficiency involves weighting Hitler's wants as equal to your own, and entirely ignores God's wants.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If you think that Hitler is bad or God is good then you have already rejected pure Kaldor-Hicks Efficiency as ideal in favor of a modified measure. Good job.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Natural rights arguments eventually fail or borrow from Christianity\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>For example, deontological libertarianism is the form of libertarianism <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Natural-rights_libertarianism&amp;oldid=797605656\\\">officially supported by the U.S. Libertarian Party</a>. In order to become a card-carrying member, one must sign an oath opposing the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. Yet, initiating force can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes. For example, yanking a child out of oncoming traffic against his will, or preventing someone from consuming a drug they believe to be innocuous which is in fact lethal.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nSo anarcho-capitalism can defend the claim that the free market leads to the most efficient distribution of resources or the maximum fulfillment of social wants, but it cannot assert this situation as morally preferred. It is not a complete framework. It has no right to call itself a preferred or better state of affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristianity provides a credible moral framework. I'm particularly a fan of <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/euthyphro-revisited/\\\">divine will theory</a>, but there are other approaches within the faith. Other religions don't satisfy the task because they are false and a minimal requirement for a credible moral framework is that the framework subsist in true claims. Irreligious worldviews such as atheism and agnosticism generally lack a moral substance. A few exceptions exist including Harris' moral landscape, but again they fail as non-preferred or non-credible. Harris' landscape, for example, fails to justify the identification of human flourishing as objectively good in the moral sense. Further, it doesn't demonstrate itself preferred to Christianity in terms of net expected individual benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew thinkers have pondered compatibility of anarcho-capitalism and Christianity. I've yet to find one who considers them compatible, but I think they are. <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/christiananarchism/comments/2l606w/greg_koukl_comments_on_christian_anarchy/\\\">Greg Koukl, for example, sees 'Christian anarchist' as a contradiction in terms</a>. He wins a semantic point, but does not deal with the substantive issue. On the free market there exist structures of authority which may be called governments. They use force and exhibit degrees of centrality which may be highly varied and inequitably distributed. Anarcho-capitalism may be relabeled as polycentric governance or a <a href=\\\"https://www.cato.org/events/market-law\\\">market for law</a> and the substantive point remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nEfficiency may not be morally beneficial on its own, but neither is it clearly bad. It seems morally neutral. Yet efficiency has the ability to multiply the real output of any system. It seems to me, then, that a society which is both Christian and economically efficient will produce more morally beneficial outcomes compared to an equally benevolent but inefficient system. In this way I see efficiency as a moral multiplier, and it becomes clear that a society which can be simultaneously efficient and Christian should be. Finally we have an appropriate and defensible prescription for society. In fact, we can say that a society which is Christian and inefficient is bad, in a moral sense, compared to one which is Christian and good. Yet either is better than a society which is not Christian.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is that anarcho-capitalism either as a school of thought or as a social order is in any case improved through integration of Christian values.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>3 - Anarcho-capitalism + Christianity is better identified with conservatism than libertarianism</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nAnarcho-capitalism is perhaps best identified with so-called libertarian conservatism or right-libertarianism, but it is invalid to claim that this label is somehow closer to pure libertarianism than pure conservatism. If we are forced to ignore the nuances of complex labels and must choose among the simple labels of conservative, liberal, or libertarian, under their American meanings, the best descriptor of a person holding the views I describe would seem to be a conservative.\\r\\n\\r\\nA conservative is socially conservative and fiscally conservative. Social conservatism is identified with Christian values. A libertarian would be a fiscal conservative and a social liberal, while a liberal would be both socially and fiscally liberal. At face value, a Christian anarcho-capitalist fits into the conservative camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly, real people do not fit neatly into their theoretical categories. I think the average self-identified conservative, whether a politician or ordinary person, is likely to support a much larger role for the State compared the the average self-identified libertarian. In practice I think I relate to libertarians as a social group better than conservatives. At the same time, I think theoretically rigorous conservatism is preferred to theoretically rigorous libertarianism because it subsumes all the gains from economics and improves upon them with Christianity.",

Some thinkers argue that the market depends on the existence of well-defined property rights, and may argue further that we need a State to defend these rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is emphatically not the case in my view. Instead, we see the market operate perfectly well when property rights are arbitrarily well defined or not defined well at all, and the market is adaptive to improve the resolution of the definition as needed. In fact, this process of market-based property rights adaptation forms the landmark paper on what property rights are in the economics literature, Demsetz' <a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230523210_9\\\">Toward a Theory of Property Rights</a> (1974).\\r\\n\\r\\nRather, I see de facto property rights as a description of what is already there when an individual protects his own property. If an individual claims he has a de facto right to some property and yet that property is taken from him, clearly he had no such right in the de facto sense. De facto property rights ultimately derive from individual power of various kinds including physical power, social influence, and so on. I think this concept, while perhaps underdeveloped for use, is theoretically much more explanatory than the typical description of property rights. For example, it seems to explain why a legal concept of property rights is inequitably, and indeed systemically inequitably, applied.",

Section II is a working outline for research. Section III identifies progress and issues to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch is designed to obtain three key objectives, with special consideration given to several secondary objectives:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Key Objectives\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Build an agent model and write a paper relevant to the economics of education</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Formally estimate an agent model and get data from it</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Study the research frontier on some advanced ABM topic</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Secondary Objectives\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n \t<li>Design an experiment in connection with an agent model</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Get up to speed on, or extend the cutting edge of, parallel agentization in JavaScript or Node C++ Add-Ons</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Rewrite a modified Sugarscape model in a parallel way</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Develop competency with the AgentScript modelling framework and another commonly used framework such as NetLogo</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\r\\n \t<li><strong>Research Outline</strong></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n2.1          Build an agent model and write a paper relevant to the economics of education\\r\\n\\r\\nA modified Sugarscape model is implemented in JavaScript to support analysis of education. The model processing architecture optionally leverages the following technologies:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>WebGL GUI via three.js</li>\\r\\n \t<li>GPU accelerated processing via gpu.js</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Parallelization via promises</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Parallelization via web workers</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Parallelization via NodeJS cluster.workers</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Parallelization via NodeJS Child Process</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Parallelization or enhanced performance via NodeJS C++ Add-ons</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Standard expression using AgentScript-next (ASX)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nThe model is implemented as a cellular automaton with a netlogo-like architecture. The NetLogo architecture includes an environment called a world and agents called turtles. The world is a finite grid of square regions called patches. Agents are called turtles. Agents traverse the world in finite time described by a tick function which executes at every tick. Patches and turtles may be subclassed as breeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nA netlogo-like model may vary from a pure NetLogo architecture in a number of ways. For example, agents may act in continuous time using an agent-scoped setTimeout function instead of a global tick function.\\r\\n\\r\\nI plan to implement four patch breeds and one agent breed. Patches include jobs, schools, homes, and uninterestings. Agents are simply turtles, representing people. A person has various preferences, work preference, leisure preference, age, level of education, and other properties. Every person has a home patch and they obtain leisure by remaining there. They must consume, however, and this motivates work. In order to work the person must travel back and forth from a job patch. Jobs pay some rate depending on level of education and some variance. Agents may decide to go to school if this results in a pay increase sufficient based on their personal preferences. This is quite a deviation from a traditional Sugarscape because there are no hills of sugar and for other reasons. Instead, there are job patches.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince all personal preferences are defined in quantitative, dollar-equivalent terms, one side effect is the possibility of the grave sin of interpersonal comparisons of utility under this implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.2          Formally estimate an agent model and get data from it\\r\\n\\r\\nData is trivially extracted from the model described in section 2.1. Data is used to estimate the effect of education on income. The secondary goal discussed in 1.2.1 can be implemented by varying world setup rules including the proportions of patch breeds or agent preferences. In addition, the effect of functionally represented voucher policies can be identified by further breeding patches.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.3          Study the research frontier on some advanced ABM topic\\r\\n\\r\\nJavaScript implementations of agent models are taken as a frontier topic, as is the ASX framework in particular. Parallelization of JavaScript is interesting within the programming community at large, let alone within ABM, as are increasingly native JavaScript integrations including C++ Add-Ons and hardware accelerated processing.\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\r\\n \t<li><strong>Progress and Issues to Date</strong></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nAn existing vanilla JavaScript implementation of Sugarscape was extended to include a generations modeling feature by adding an age property to agents and establishing birth and death rules. A second model was developed as a modified diffuse model and written in ASX.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ASX model is preferred because ASX is netlogo-like by design at the framework level, ASX is a more standard implementation, and several features like a 3D GUI are offered with minimal configuration required.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a complex and young framework, however, ASX has presented issues. The framework did not originally build on Windows and was not offered as an importable package, module, or library. Tasks to date include coordination with the principle framework author to overcome these issues. The current model is now able to leverage a modern JavaScript developer setup including a Express and Webpack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several known framework-level issues including a technical issue around the isntatntiion of agent breeds, but no known issues are critical to the particular model in progress. If such issues arise, falling back to AgentScript v1.x or vanilla JavaScript is possible.",

I expect at least two double-spaced pages of answers per question. </span><span class=\\\"_4yxo _4yxp\\\">Question #1</span><span class=\\\"_4yxp\\\"> is mandatory, and you may choose any </span><span class=\\\"_4yxo _4yxp\\\">three </span><span class=\\\"_4yxp\\\">to answer from the remaining options below the line. Your responses must be emailed to me by the end of our assigned final exam by 1:15 pm on December 13th. Best of luck!</span></div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #1 (Mandatory)</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">George Stigler argued in his famous article, “Law or Economics?,” that “every durable social institution or practice is efficient, or it would not persist over time.” Choose one political institution, practice, or policy which has proven durable over time <span class=\\\"_4yxo _4yxp\\\">and with which you disagree</span> and explain how it is efficient according to Stigler’s conception of efficiency. In your answer, you must demonstrate a firm understanding of what Stigler means and how it applies to the issue you choose.</div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Choose Three:</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #2</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">Multiple theories have been presented for the origins of states in human history, including, most notably, the “strongman hypothesis,” the “hydraulic hypothesis,” and the “conquest theory.” How do these arguments parallel certain modern justifications for states over anarchy and justifications for state intervention into markets? Give examples.</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #3</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">Social scientists studying voting behavior have offered theories of instrumental voting, expressive voting, and (in the case of Bryan Caplan) rational irrationality. In terms of whom voters intend to benefit with their vote, there are theories of self-interested, group interested, sociotropic, and ideological voting. <span class=\\\"_4yxp\\\">Drawing on both theory and the evidence that we discussed in class</span>, present your best argument for the course and results of the 2016 presidential elections. To quote the title of Hillary Clinton’s memoir on the process, tell me your version of “What Happened.”</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #4</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">Choose your favorite model in the field of Behavioral Political Economy from among those that we discussed in class. Apply it to a recent national issue (say, in the last two years). Discuss the ability of that model to explain the events and popular or institutional responses that you observe relative to the explanatory power of more conventional economic and public choice theories that do not rely upon behavioral assumptions.</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #5</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">Does the U.S. federal model effectively promote political competition, or is competition among state governments to the benefit of citizens too utopian an idea? In your answer, you must demonstrate knowledge of the arguments for both sides and make a strong case for one or the other using evidence drawn from history, current events, or empirical sources.</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #6</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">Friedrich Hayek and many other economists have argued for the superiority of emergent <span class=\\\"_4yxp\\\">common law</span> and evolved rules over <span class=\\\"_4yxp\\\">legislation</span>, which, they argue, is not formed according to considerations of what is efficient from the standpoint of interested parties. Transpose this dichotomy—of evolved decision making rules versus rules passed down by authorities—to a different context. Explain an instance <span class=\\\"_4yxp\\\">outside of law</span> in which rules are discovered through trial and error and make an argument for whether, in that context, the rules which emerge through discovery are superior to rules dictated by an authority.</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #7</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">You have been invited to debate a U.S. senator on the challenges faced by American political institutions and the U.S. economy. The senator, a former businessman, is known for touting his corporate experience and “business acumen.” He has made his opening statement, in which he argued that America needs is to 1) elect more businessmen to public office, 2) appoint more former businessmen to lead executive branch departments, and 3) run government like a corporation. Using what you learned about bureaucratic versus private incentives, offer the most comprehensive response that you can to his proposals.</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #8</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">A noted economist proposes a constitutional amendment in which Congress can no longer raise the federal government’s debt ceiling (the upper limit on the national debt) without a majority of all state governments’ approval (either the governors or state legislatures or both). Analyze the possible effects of such a rule, along with any unintended consequences that might result from it. In consideration of those effects, argue for or against the amendment.</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #9</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">In recent years, several U.S. states have begun to research the use of digital technology to monitor when cars enter and exit public highways in order to charge drivers for their use of highways. Suppose that a local politician is introducing legislation to bring such a model to your state. Drivers would be charged $0 to enter the highway but would be charged a small, variable rate <span class=\\\"_4yxp\\\">per mile driven</span>. The politician claims that it will help to resolve the state’s growing traffic congestion problems. How does this alter the nature of the highways as a public good? Does it transform them into a private good? A club good? Something else? Which narrow interests might lobby for such a policy change? Which might lobby against it? What unintended consequences might result? (For full credit, you must address all of these questions.)</div>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\"><span class=\\\"_4yxo\\\">Question #10</span></div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa\\\">In the words of Gordon Tullock, “What’s so bad about dictatorship?” Writing from an economic standpoint (rather than ethical or ideological) and drawing upon any concepts you have gleaned from this semester, present your best argument.</div>",

    "title": "Metaphorical Truth and Metaphorical Legs",
    "date": "2018-03-15",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "Jordan Peterson discusses metaphorical truth and in one place states that metaphorical truth is \\\"more true\\\" than literal truth. I agree and disagree. I think metaphorical truth is more true when it has legs and less true when it doesn't have legs. This article briefly explains what I mean by that and why I think so.\\r\\n\\r\\nA metaphorical truth has legs when it is true both in metaphor and in literal observation. For example, Peterson refers often to the Archetype of Christ. The Archetype of Christ has legs if and only if it is constituted of claims which are metaphorically true and literally true. Some such claims include:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Son of God</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Died and Rose Again</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Lived a Sinless Life</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Forgives Sins</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nMetaphorical truths are hollow, or without legs, if they are not literally true. I believe this hollow nature undercuts the metaphorical nature of the truth of the claim: If it's not actually or literally true than it's not true at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, if a statement is both literally true and metaphorically true, it is most true in its metaphorical form. Why? Because that metaphorical form is more generic, and it can be implemented into many truth claims, all of which are concretely true. This metaphorical truth has the same advantages of a generic function over a concrete function in the sciences, programming, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider that the following statements are concretely true:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Jim is 10 and weighs 100 lbs</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Joe is 15 and weighs 150 lbs</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Jake is 20 and weighs 200 lbs</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nGiven many observations we could eventually determine a more generic truth:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>People's weight is generally 10 times their age</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nNow of course that's not actually true. It's just to illustrate the notion that abstracted, generic truths can capture many concrete truths in a small, efficient statement. This sort of inducted, or otherwise arrived at, generic truth is analogous or even nearly identical to the metaphorical truths I see in Peterson - with one key difference. Peterson doesn't guarantee the truth of his metaphorical claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nI continue to agree with Peterson up until this point. Induction from observation is not the only logical method of analysis. Other methods of analysis, including inference to the best explanation, deductive, and other forms of reasoning, allow generic truth claims to be generated without appealing to observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI support the notion that a generic, or metaphorical, truth should be held as valid in the absence of a defeater, where empirical evidence to the contrary may form a defeater. Consider that we identify a metaphorical truth, and the empirical truth can take three forms:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>It agrees</li>\\r\\n \t<li>It disagrees</li>\\r\\n \t<li>It is unknown</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nOnly under condition 2 is the metaphorical truth defeated in my view, and my concern is that Peterson doesn't share that concern. I agree with Peterson, however, in holding the generic or metaphorical truth as valid under a condition of unknown empirical truth. This relates to my old discussion on the <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn0zjQ-Mi9s\\\">Law of Unobservable Phenomena</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also agree that the metaphorical truth is more true than any particular concrete truth, so long as it is undefeated, because it covers all concretely true statements and then makes additional true statements. It also does so in a conveniently small package, which makes it easier to comprehend in a person's mind. I think a person can be more confident in a truth claim which they more fully comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I will appeal to Peterson himself for consistency. I think the notion that metaphorical truth must have legs in order to be actually true is consistent with his entire thesis in 12 Rules for Life. See the following clip:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://youtu.be/OCePjMIhY4o?t=4m24s\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host states that he is concerned about an ethic of hyper-individualism, where a person only attends to their own things and never to communal issues. Peterson agrees, stating that he does not advocate for any such hyper-individualistic ethic. Rather, one must accomplish the elementary task of personal improvement before effectively attempting the complex task of social improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is exactly parallel to my message: A truth must accomplish the elementary task of being actually true before it attempts the complex task of becoming a deep metaphorical truth. I agree we can come to know deep metaphorical truths by means other than induction from concrete instances, perhaps while being ignorant of the empirical truth or even in such cases as the empirical truth may be unverifiable or non-falsifiable. But I by no means agree that we can hold metaphorical truths in the presence of reasonable empirical evidence to the contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is a reasonable degree of empirical evidence? That's actually a complex question which is asked in the sciences all the time. It's a separate question I won't go into here. I do think axiomatically derived truths carry some amount of weight; it's not as if one or two anecdotes, or even one or two moderately good academic papers, should defeat a decently grounded structurally derived claim. But there is some point at which the empirical becomes more plausible and comparatively credible.",

    "content": "In 2013 I talked about how the planet would easily accommodate <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/water-food-9-billion-people-2040/\\\">food and water for 9 billion people</a> in 2040. In this article, I argue that the current <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism\\\">Malthusian</a> scare about running out of fossil fuels is equally overblown and unimportant. I also argue that climate change is not at all an important economic or political concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>1 - We will likely never exhaust our fossil fuel</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"https://ourworldindata.org/how-long-before-we-run-out-of-fossil-fuels\\\">Current, mainstream estimates</a> state that we will run out of oil and natural gas in about 50 years, and we will run out of coal in about 100 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese estimates are incorrect. They ignore 4 key effects:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>New technologies</li>\\r\\n \t<li>New fossil fuel discoveries</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Supply and demand\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>In the market for fossil fuels</li>\\r\\n \t<li>In the market for alternative energy sources including wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nPeak oil was and is a lie. It was called in the 1970s, but new technology leading to better fossil fuel discovery, utilization, and efficient burning put United States output today at rates as high as it was during peak oil.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6634\\\" src=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/peak-oil-lie.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"884\\\" height=\\\"601\\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice that this 45 year gap is smaller than the alleged 50 year stockpile of existing fossil fuels. This means we could have another boom of fossil fuel discoveries and improved utilization before we run out, kicking the can down the road another 50 years. This is far from certain and dare I say unlikely, but it shouldn't be a completely ignored possibility as is done with anyone putting the oil estimate at 50 years remaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow different was technology and the world 50 years ago? The internet didn't exist, automobile fuel efficiency was a joke, and so on. Forecasts at such long range are difficult to do accurately.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplicating the matter further is the fact that fuel consumption is endogenous. A 50 year time horizon is based on relatively constant usage, but supply and demand indicate usage will not be constant. As the supply dwindles the price of fuels will increasing. A higher price will drive down consumption and it will also create an incentive to use the existing supply more efficiently. This is not speculative. The Washington Post notes as much about the 2000s USA in <em><a href=\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/12/13/cars-in-the-u-s-are-more-fuel-efficient-than-ever-heres-how-it-happened/?utm_term=.eebe13b11aa5\\\">Cars in the U.S. are more fuel-efficient than ever. Here’s how it happened</a>.</em>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe price of gas in the US <a href=\\\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-915-march-7-2016-average-historical-annual-gasoline-pump-price-1929-2015\\\">grew extremely high from 2005 - 2015</a> and has recently dropped, but during that period we see <a href=\\\"https://www.epa.gov/fuel-economy-trends/highlights-co2-and-fuel-economy-trends#Highlight1\\\">the fuel economy of cars being spurred</a>, for the very reasons outlined above. While the price of oil has recovered, the technological progress achieved in that time has not reversed. Fuel-efficient cars and even electric cars are taking over, and we see additional gains in the near future with such trends as <a href=\\\"https://www.tesla.com/model3\\\">Tesla's affordable Model 3</a>, self-driving cars, and <a href=\\\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/8/16613228/uber-flying-car-la-nasa-space-act\\\">even flying cars</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to fuel-related technologies, alternatives such as wind and solar saw gains. Not only did the price endogenously create an incentive for technology, consumers <a href=\\\"https://phys.org/news/2016-09-gasoline-consumption-higher.html\\\">also reduced consumption in the face of higher prices</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you think the point I'm making is that 50-100 years underestimates the lifespan of our existing fossil fuels, you are both right and also missing the point. I don't think we will ever exhaust our fossil fuels, including oil. <a href=\\\"https://www.flyingmag.com/electric-aircraft-might-become-an-industry-standard-sooner-than-expected\\\">Electric aviation</a> is set to become a thing over the next decade. Aviation and motor transportation are the main uses of oil. Europe consumes finished gasoline about 33% as much as the US, and <a href=\\\"https://www.indexmundi.com/energy/?region=eu&amp;product=gasoline&amp;graph=consumption\\\">their consumption has been declining as well</a>. USA consumes about <a href=\\\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&amp;t=10\\\">9.32 million barrels per day</a>, so USA + Europe is about 12.5 million barrels per day, which is more than half of the world's production of about <a href=\\\"https://www.indexmundi.com/energy/?product=gasoline&amp;graph=production\\\">22.5 million barrels per day</a>. Keep in mind that world production is increasing, not declining. About <a href=\\\"http://evadoption.com/ev-market-share/\\\">one-fifth of USA car sales</a> in the are projected to be all-electric by 2025, and Europe will be no doubt close behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon we will be faced with way more finished gasoline than we need. There is no oil problem. Now, this does leave the coal problem, but we have more than 100 years to deal with that, and it is becoming less of a problem each day. Just like with gas, coal is being more efficiently used over time, it's burning cleaner over time, and new coal deposits are discovered over time. In addition, alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and nuclear are being increasingly utilized to displace coal. <a href=\\\"https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2016/july/renewable-energy-continuing-to-increase-market-share.html\\\">From 1990 through 2014</a>, energy from renewable sources grew faster than the total primary energy supply (TPES). In other words, the energy market is became increasingly based on renewable sources, particularly wind and solar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis trend hasn't slowed down. <a href=\\\"https://www.iea.org/publications/renewables2017/\\\">Renewables outpaced non-renewables in 2016</a> and Solar PV energy alone grew faster on net than coal. Don't worry about the developing world either. Non-OECD countries <a href=\\\"https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2016/july/renewable-energy-continuing-to-increase-market-share.html\\\">consume around 75% of all renewables</a>. Because of the use of wood as an energy source, for example, nearly half of all energy in Africa is renewable. China has also been called <a href=\\\"https://www.iea.org/publications/renewables2017/\\\">the undisputed leader of renewables</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>2 - Climate change is not a problem to be solved</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nI've shown above that there is no energy crisis and I show here that there is no climate change crisis. Take a look:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>97% of climate scientists do not think human action is the main cause of climate change. They simply think <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surveys_of_scientists%27_views_on_climate_change&amp;oldid=837899904#John_Cook_et_al.,_2013\\\">humans are a contributing factor</a>. As of 2013, only about 2% of climate scientists thought that. <a href=\\\"http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/a-climate-falsehood-you-can-check-for.html\\\">Independent</a> and even <a href=\\\"https://niskanencenter.org/blog/should-skeptics-concede-the-climate-consensus/\\\">left-wing sources</a> make note of this. The degree of human contribution, though, is current debate topic, and the IPCC 5th Report's position of <a href=\\\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-scientists-think-100-of-global-warming-is-due-to-humans\\\">100% causation is at the extreme</a>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Through 2014, an average of published models intended to predict global warming <a href=\\\"https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/05/31/in-house-testimony-botkin-dismantles-the-ipcc-2014-report/\\\">had overestimated the rate of global warming by more than 100%</a>. See the image below.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Taking an average of <a href=\\\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming\\\">selected, high-accuracy models</a>, estimates are still about 5% over observation.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Notice that the IPCC's 4th report is more accurate than their 5th report. Indeed, the 4th report is the most accurate model noted according to CarbonBrief, although I'm not sure exactly how that accuracy was computed. An average of their <a href=\\\"https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html\\\">middle two scenarios</a> (B2/AB1) puts the estimated centennial warming at 2.6 degrees Celsius, but the 4th report was released in 2013 so the 8% error rate identified by CarbonBrief seems to be relative to historical data rather than future prediction.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>My own calculation, <a href=\\\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/\\\">using NASA GISS data</a>, puts the Lowess-smoothed average from 2000 to 2017 at 2.6 degrees Celsius (.95-.5/17).</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Also notice that CarbonBrief seems to overrate the accuracy of these models. The IPCC's 1st report was issued in 1990, so why is CarbonBrief including data samples back to 1970? If you look at observed data after 1990, and until 2015, IPCC's 1st report <a href=\\\"http://www.climatedepot.com/2015/11/04/no-global-warming-at-all-for-18-years-9-months-a-new-record-the-pause-lengthens-again-just-in-time-for-un-summit-in-paris/\\\">has an error rate of over 275%</a> (.72/.26 = 2.77). This is far worse than the 30% error rate noted by CarbonBrief. Observed data is well outside the extremes of the IPCC-1 confidence interval.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Grant alarmists their most extreme position and notice how non-problematic it is.\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surveys_of_scientists%27_views_on_climate_change&amp;oldid=837899904#STATS,_2007\\\">In 2007</a> and again <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surveys_of_scientists%27_views_on_climate_change&amp;oldid=837899904#Farnsworth_and_Lichter,_2011\\\">in 2011</a>, a plurality (44%) of climate change scientists thought the effects of global warming would be moderate. Scientists generally thought the effects would be moderate rather than catastrophic.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Even if we achieved such warming the results could be beneficial rather than catastrophic. Global warming <a href=\\\"https://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-is-wrong-with-global-warming.html\\\">could lead to net economic gains</a> because it can improve crop yield and creates more inhabitable space than it eliminates. <a href=\\\"https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/\\\">NASA echoes David Friedman</a> here, saying, \\\"Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen.\\\"</li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\\\">The Paris Agreement</a> represents the main political ambition of energy regulation initiatives groups like <a href=\\\"https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/human-contribution-to-gw-faq.html#.Wu-XV4gvyHs\\\">UCSUSA</a>. This agreement recommends action to prevent a 2 degree Celsius warming over the 21st century, but why that number? This seems to be a matter of politics not science. I also find it likely we will achieve that goal without any additional government action. Notice that IPCC estimates do not account for consumption and technology changes identified in section 1, and also note that some government action has already been taken at the time of writing, May 2018.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>As discussed in section 1, the market is naturally moving towards reduced carbon emissions and cleaner energies anyway.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Take a gander at the assorted articles under the section entitled <em>The Global Warming Myth</em> on this page. Keep in mind, I don't deny that the earth is heating up, and I don't even deny that up to 100% of observed warming in the past century is <a href=\\\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-scientists-think-100-of-global-warming-is-due-to-humans\\\">anthropomorphically attributable</a>. I simply deny that political action including regulation is a net-positive solution.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6637\\\" src=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/predictions-vs-real-world.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"383\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" />",

    "title": "Lower House Prices",
    "date": "2018-06-04",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "I recently wrote that 3D printed houses should start to become <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/3d-printed-houses-us-2020/\\\">relatively accessible around 2020</a>. This article discusses a few techniques other than 3D printing which can drive down house costs. I look at the home price problem as a home owner and also as a real estate investor, where the latter cares about unit price and the former cares more about absolute price.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.24hplans.com/how-much-does-it-cost-build-new-house/\\\">24hplans.com</a> says the average US home cost for 2017 - 2018 is about $257k. <a href=\\\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/architects-and-engineers/build-a-house/\\\">Homeadvisor</a> has it at $289k for 2018. Average home size is about 2500 square feet. Average apartment cost, however, is about <a href=\\\"https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-apartment\\\">75k according to fixr.com</a>. The average apartment is about 860 square feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are 5 strategies to reduce housing cost:\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>1 - Look in more locations, buy used instead of new, and look at a smaller space.</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the obvious ideas. First, housing prices vary significantly by country, state, city, and even neighborhood. Usually, a used house costs less than a similarly-sized new house. I say usually because <a href=\\\"http://www.fedprimerate.com/preowned_used-home_sales_price_history.htm\\\">so far this year</a> there isn't much difference on average between new and used, but expanding the number of options in your area will generally allow you to find something cheaper even if the averages are similar, just due to market size effects. Finally, smaller homes cost less.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>2 - Add on instead of moving</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nSelling a house and buying a new house can easily net $10-20k+ in costs, plus moving expenses, plus the hassle of it all. If you are moving just to get an extra room, consider hiring a contractor to <a href=\\\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/additions-and-remodels/build-an-addition/#architect\\\">build an addition instead</a>. You could build an addition starting around $20k and your home value will increase as a result, reducing the effective cost.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>3 - Tiny Homes and modular homes</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nTiny homes take the idea of a smaller home to the extreme. This usually refers to <a href=\\\"https://www.floorplans.com/collection/tiny-floor-plans\\\">homes under 1000 square feet</a>. You can even buy an entire premade tiny home on ebay or Amazon:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/MODS-40-Foot-Tiny-Home/dp/B073FZ8PP9\\\">MODS 40 Foot Tiny Home</a>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Low rating, but it's cheap, stackable 3 tall, and compliant with building codes in most states. See image below. Other builds on <a href=\\\"https://www.modsinternational.com\\\">their website</a>.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Being stackable lowers the effective unit cost because you don't have to pay for additional ground work including excavation and so on.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/TINY-HOUSE-410-SQ-FT-1-2-BED-1-BATH-KITCHEN-DINING-LIVING-STEEL-GLASS-MODERN/183058443499?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D50544%26meid%3D5ab1d2b7121a48e8b94fd1c4dbf04a69%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D12%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D323271490501%26itm%3D183058443499&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851\\\">TINY HOUSE 410 SQ FT</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/TINY-HOME-12x45-540SF-100SF-LOFT-1BR-1BA-THE-ELARA-TINY-HOUSE-STUDIO-GUEST/122815044920?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D50544%26meid%3Dd32fcbb2d09d4a0abb19aae5c552eb4a%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D12%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D183058443499%26itm%3D122815044920&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851\\\">TINY HOME 12'x45' 540SF +100SF LOFT 1BR 1BA</a></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<img class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6656\\\" src=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mod-stackable-home-1024x388.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"605\\\" height=\\\"229\\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore purchasing, make sure the unit you are purchasing is building code compliant. <a href=\\\"https://www.buildingsguide.com/blog/resources-building-codes-state/\\\">This site</a> has some useful links on US building code regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>4 - Live in an RV</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's like a tiny house with wheels! RVs put the tiny in tiny house, usually coming in with under 500 square feet of livable space, but they also have unique benefits like you can take them on vacation and they often include basic appliances or even furniture. Take a look at these two options for example:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Home-Ultimate-Vacation-Weekend/dp/B0771NM4R5/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528082045&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=tiny+home\\\">Tiny Home - Park Model RV: Ultimate Vacation Home or Weekend Getaway, 12 x 36</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Home-Ultimate-Vacation-Weekend/dp/B0772VGGC9/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528082045&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=tiny+home\\\">Tiny Home - Park Model RV: Ultimate Vacation Home or Weekend Getaway, 15 x 26</a></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>5 - Buy a fucking barn type thing</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of buying a tiny home, consider buying an almost-home and working with a contractor to turn it into a livable space by adding better insulation, central heating, and additional interior walls. Done right, some of these conversions could result in a larger living space for a lower price. It turns out <a href=\\\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/converted-barns-renovating-inspiration/all\\\">barn conversion is kind of a trend in architecture</a> these days anyway, although not all of these buildings are barns.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some metal buildings which could be converted into a livable space:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/DuroSPAN-Steel-30x34x14-Metal-Building-Custom-Roof-Kit-Open-Ends-Factory-DiRECT/253644930145?_trkparms=aid%3D888007%26algo%3DDISC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D50544%26meid%3Dc62b9e6bc43a4c458f7b735bf1fab2c9%26pid%3D100009%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D142750819256%26itm%3D253644930145&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100009.m1982\\\">DuroSPAN Steel 30x34x14 Metal Building Custom Roof Kit Open Ends Factory DiRECT</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/Metal-Barn-44x31-A-Frame-Steel-Building-4-Car-Garage-Agricultural-FREE-INSTALL/332609531796?_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D50544%26meid%3De60a7df782ea416192906015289ade3d%26pid%3D100623%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D6%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D310180946595%26itm%3D332609531796&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100623.m-1\\\">Metal Barn 44x31 A-Frame Steel Building 4 Car Garage Agricultural FREE INSTALL</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/DuroSPAN-Steel-30x50x14-Metal-DIY-Garage-Building-As-Seen-on-TV-Factory-DiRECT/253651276458?_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D50544%26meid%3D5ab1d2b7121a48e8b94fd1c4dbf04a69%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D6%26rkt%3D12%26sd%3D323271490501%26itm%3D253651276458&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851\\\">DuroSPAN Steel 30x50x14 Metal DIY Garage Building \\\"As Seen on TV\\\" Factory DiRECT</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/Steel-Building-24x24-SIMPSON-Metal-Building-Kit-Garage-Workshop-Structure-Prefab/142750819256?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D50544%26meid%3D5ab1d2b7121a48e8b94fd1c4dbf04a69%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D12%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D323271490501%26itm%3D142750819256&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851\\\">Steel Building 24x24 SIMPSON Metal Building Kit Garage Workshop Structure Prefab</a></li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>6 - 3D Printing, again</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nI already mentioned the 5 options to reduce home prices other than 3D printing, but I wanted to revisit 3D printing itself. How much would it cost to 3D print a home? ICON and Apis Cor indicate costs of around $10k, but I haven't been able to get responses to actual purchase inquiries, and sales price is expected to be higher than cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of contacting someone else to do the work, it's possible to purchase a printer and do the work ourselves. This list of <a href=\\\"https://www.aniwaa.com/house-3d-printer-construction/\\\">16 house construction 3D printers</a> includes 3 non-service, non-prototype 3D printers for sale today. The Machines-3D 3D Constructor can only reach 1.8m, though, so let's count it out. That leaves us with 2 options:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>BetAbram P1. Made in Slovenia, costing about $40k.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Cazza X1. Made in the US, costing about $500k.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nCazza is apparently being used to build a skyscraper, so it seems to be the better option for scale and vertical construction. Building vertically has the general advantage of economizing on groundwork. If we are fine with single-story builds, however, BetAbram appears to be able to get the job done. I would personally start with the BetAbram to minimize upfront cost, but if I had deeper pockets I would go for the Cazza.",

    "content": "I previously wrote about <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/lower-home-prices-part-2/\\\">finding lower priced housing</a>, but low prices still aren't free. At some point you have to pay up. This article assembles a number of traditional and less traditional funding sources you may not have considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of these financing techniques can be used for other purposes including debt consolidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 1 goes through general loan and equity access options which do not require current real estate ownership. Section 2 goes through real estate-backed lending options. Section 3 explores basic commercial finance options. Section 4 goes through real estate purchase structures which can lower down payment.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Section 1 - Personal Loan and Equity Access Options</strong>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Purchase Real Estate with IRA\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>You can use your <a href=\\\"https://www.thebalance.com/rules-of-buying-real-estate-in-an-ira-2388761\\\">IRA to purchase investment property</a>, but it's subject to certain rules.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Unlike the 401(k) options discussed below, this IRA approach does not have any additional fees or penalties if done correctly.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Three of the most important rules in using this approach in my opinion:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>You can't mortgage the property purchased.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>You can't live in the property purchased. It must purely be an investment.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Income gained from the IRA property is paid into the IRA.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>One thing I'm not sure about - the rule that you can't mortgage an IRA purchased property: Does that mean you can't finance at all, or you still have non-mortgage finance options? Can you mix IRA money and non-IRA money in a deal?</li>\\r\\n \t<li>First-time home buyer exception: You can withdraw from your IRA to help buy a home as <a href=\\\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/110415/can-you-use-your-ira-buy-house.asp\\\">a first-time home buyer</a>. You are considered a first-time homebuyer if you haven’t owned a home (or had financial interest in one) at any point during the last two years. So, even if you owned a house at some point in the past – say, five years ago – you may well meet the first-time buyer requirement.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>You can move money between an IRA and 401(k) without penalty in many cases.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Liquidate your 401(k)\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Cryptocurrency has a much higher return compared to traditional 401(k). You could cash out of your 401(k) and invest in crypto and make a bigger retirement gain.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If you believe option 1.1 then you think of 401(k) more as a constraint on investing and less as a beneficial asset - but you still might <a href=\\\"https://www.analystforum.com/forums/water-cooler/91317429\\\">intentionally circulate your 401(k)</a> to make income gains through employer match, intentionally taking the early withdrawal penalty but netting ahead of standard income. Look out for vesting considerations and be sure to actually run the numbers as this could easily cause income loss in some cases.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Keep in mind that liquidating your 401(k) could potentially utterly ruin your retirement. This would be considered risky stuff according to standard financial analysts.

I'm talking about the latter here.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Access the equity in your car to back a loan.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>As far as I know, this is a really shitty option. The car loans I've seen have interest rates comparable to a credit card, with the added bonus that you can lose your car.

Holding cash in a savings account for more than 60 days will <a href=\\\"https://themortgagereports.com/21479/borrow-downpayment-funds\\\">season the money</a>, allowing it to be used in a down payment.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Put it on a credit card!\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>This is an awful way to finance a whole down payment, but I don't think it's an unreasonable addition to a financing mix.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Getting a new card might hurt your credit score, so be careful.

Obvious disclaimer: Conducting a proper business is hard.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>Section 2 - Real estate-backed finance options</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nAccessing real estate equity through finance may be financially preferred to liquidation in order to fund a new purchase. A property owner can avoid many of the fees associated with the sale transaction, and possibly economize on some of the purchase transaction fees. By reducing expenses, the total purchasing power available towards the purchased property is increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk and time-cost can also be reduced this way. With a finance strategy, no negotiation between buyers and sellers needs to happen after the appraisal. Temporal delays of buying and selling are reduced. Certain other stresses may be reduced or eliminated, like holding open house and moving furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you do intend to sell instead of finance, by the way, check out some of these interesting real estate services:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Discount agencies\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.redfin.com/about/one-percent-listing-fee\\\">Redfin</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.purplebricks.com\\\">Purple Bricks</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://houwzer.com\\\">Houwzer</a></li>\\r\\n \t<li>Beware of <a href=\\\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/02/02/2198304/jefferies-claims-just-half-of-purplebricks-customers-sell-their-homes-within-10-months/\\\">certain issues</a> related to discount agencies. Even so, the math might favor this approach.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Premium agencies\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>An alternative strategy is to intentionally pay more for a top quality agent which can potentially help buy and sell faster and with better pricing.</li>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.upnest.com/re/buysell-compare\\\">Upnest</a> can help with that.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nOn to the financing options themselves:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Second Mortgage\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>I'm a big proponent of the second mortgage. It can be used to gain cash which could make a high interest investment, netting gain over a low home loan interest rate, or for debt consolidation or other purposes.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Another good use would be to use a second mortgage to get rid of your property mortgage insurance.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>If you are interested in purchasing a non-primary residence without selling your house, this is a great option.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>By making minimum payments on a second mortgage, like a first mortgage, you will accrue equity. You would eventually be able to refinance the mortgage and potentially roll it back into the first mortgage.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>HELOC\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>A home equity line of credit is a great alternative to a credit card. Many lenders will even issue a card which spends out of a HELOC account. If your intent is to cut up your credit cards, a HELOC can work the same way with a lower rate, higher limit, and lower payments.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>But, if your intent is to really finance a longer term property purchase or investment, HELOC is decidedly worse than a second mortgage. Payments are interest-only and making minimum payments may result in a growing balance. You never gain equity with HELOC and the rates are higher than second mortgage.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Bridge loans\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>This is a pretty whack option in most cases, but it exists. A bridge loan can be issued when you are trying to sell one property and buy another property. In many cases you should just wait for the sale to go through, but the bridge loan can be used if you can't afford to wait on the sale to go through.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Portfolio Loan\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>If you own even a single property you can enter into a portfolio loan which may allow the equity in existing property to be used as a down payment on the purchase of additional property.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>This becomes a decent option if you already have equity in a single property, but it becomes a best-of-breed option if you have equity in more than one property.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<strong>3 - Commercial Lending Options</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial loans don't come in a ton of unique flavors. There's pretty much just a commercial loan, which is an alternative to a personal loan available to legally formed businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of accessing new loan structures, using a business will allow you to access special terms under the structures already mentioned in sections 1 and 2 often have special terms for legally structured businesses. Some deal structures mentioned in section 4 are only available to commercial entities, or businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an example, LendingClub will issue personal loans up to $40,000, but they will issue business loans up to $300,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can literally start a corporation for under $1000 and take advantages of some of these options.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial loans have a huge liability benefit. If a company you own goes bankrupt, depending on the formation of the business, you may have little to no personal liability.\\r\\n\\r\\nLimiting liability also makes it easier to work with other people which can really open up doors. Be careful though, poorly structured terms can easily ruin your personal ability to obtain return on investment.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>4 - Deal </strong><b>Structures</b>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>FHA loan\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>As little as <a href=\\\"https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-learning/fha-loan/\\\">3.5% down</a> on a primary residence. Keep in mind that a duplex, triplex, or even a 4-plex may be considered a primary residence depending on your state.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>I don't believe 5+ units in a building can be considered a primary residence in any state.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>A legal divorce might make you and your significant other able to each purchase an FHA-backed 4-plex, getting 8 units between yourselves with 3.5% down. Your significant other might get a little mad if you ask though ;)</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>VA Loan\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li><a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/mortgages-no-or-small-down-payment-1.aspx\\\">If you are a veteran</a> you can get $0 down and other cool financing options</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Navy Federal Credit Union\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>$0 down like a VA loan, but <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/mortgages-no-or-small-down-payment-1.aspx\\\">veteran family members can qualify</a> in addition to actual veterans. Some fees are a bit higher.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>USDA Loan\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>$0 down, but you have to <a href=\\\"https://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/mortgages-no-or-small-down-payment-1.aspx\\\">buy rural land and other qualifications apply</a> like income limits.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>SBA Loan\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>SBA offers <a href=\\\"http://www.mymortgagebanker.com/SBA-504-Loans.php\\\">a number of loan structures</a> for legal businesses, which can finance a property at 90-100%+. That is, 10 to 0% down or even less. Yes, in some cases they will pay you instead of you paying a down payment.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Piggyback Loan\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>One of my favorites. A piggyback loan occurs by opening a first and second mortgage at the same time. This will generally result in a higher interest paid, but it may cancel PMI resulting in a net lower monthly and faster equity accrual, or it may be used to reduce the down payment required.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Explore lenders and sellers\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>Traditional commercial loans are 20% down but some banks, even without a special structure, may allow 10% down. Private loans can be 5% down without a special structure, just by getting a good deal.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Other banks may not advertise such terms but you may be able to get special terms just by asking, and particularly by presenting a deal from a competitor and asking for better terms. For low dollar deals you will get some eye rolls but for higher dollar deals you will see increasingly flexible terms, or sometimes completely custom contracts. This will be particular the case when working with lenders other than traditional banks, such as credit unions or hard money lenders.</li>\\r\\n \t<li>You can see some really creative deals when engaging property owners directly, without an intermediary. Sky's the limit.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>",

    "title": "Against Moral Autodeterminism",
    "date": "2018-06-23",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "This article argues that secular moral autodetermism is an equally poor option compared to secular nihilism, and therefore secularism is once again non-preferred to Christianity.\\r\\n\\r\\nCountless somebodies and nobodies have written on Rules for Life. The trend is given new attention with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Rules_for_Life\\\">Peterson's 12 Rules for Life</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EihqXHqxri0\\\">Chris Pratt's equally good 9 Rules for Life</a>. I began to think about my own rules for life. I often go back to a simple framework of \\\"Do what's good for your body, mind, and spirit.\\\" While all of these can be made complex, I think the third one is the hardest to communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of the key aspects of a spiritual life in my view are purpose and desire. Two intelligent, informed people can disagree about the optimality of a choice if they have divergent purposes or desires. That observation separates these concerns in my view from purely mental considerations. When we say some action is outside the letter of the law but within the spirit of that law, what we mean is that the action was teleologically consistent with the law. It was consistent with respect to purpose, intent, desire, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think morality is strongly related to spirituality. Morality is the set of beliefs about what should and should not be done. As earlier discussed, this is determined not purely by mental capacity or awareness of facts, but by the combination of such concerns with desire and purpose. In economics, for example, we cannot optimize utility by being aware only of the goods and services available and their prices. To determine an optimal purchase we also need to know individual preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nI generally think atheism is the second best religion. If someone is a Muslim and they won't become Christian, I would still prefer they move to atheism rather than remain Muslim. I think atheism is to accounting like Christianity is to economics. I've previously<a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?ei=a58uW8CpOc_4zgL7-aKQBg&amp;q=site%3Aafterecon.com+atheism&amp;oq=site%3Aafterecon.com+atheism&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1627.2465.0.2592.8.8.0.0.0.0.85.506.8.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.U8iXze2hoGM\\\"> written many articles</a> undermining atheism in various ways. One common approach is to show that neither particular morality nor purpose follows from atheism, and it is therefore amoral, morally subjective, or nihilistic. As an amoral or morally subjective framework, in a non-compatibility sense, it would be absurd. As a nihilistic framework it would be pointless, useless, and not worth adopting even if true.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne response which I, and I think many professional academics, usually dismiss as juvenile is moral autodeterminism. That is, the secularist communicates something in the spirit of the following:\\r\\n<blockquote>It may be that atheism doesn't bind me to a particular moral code, but this hardly prevents me from adopting any moral code of my choosing. I can simply choose an arbitrary purpose or moral code for myself.</blockquote>\\r\\nIn the first place this is ridiculous and unwarranted. The absence of belief cannot warrant the positive assertion of some other belief, so the weak atheist has no grounds on which to say their moral choices are preferred to an objective standard like Christianity. In the second place this often works out hilariously. Consider that Richard Dawkins considers himself a <a href=\\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/10853648/Richard-Dawkins-I-am-a-secular-Christian.html\\\">cultural Christian</a>. He has once again, as Turek would say, borrowed from the hand of God to slap him in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third place, let me dispute moral autodeterminism more formally:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>A preferred moral framework obtains the maximum amount of great-making properties</li>\\r\\n \t<li>A moral framework is given great-making properties by its creator(s)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>God possesses the maximum degree of all great-making properties</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Therefore, God's moral framework is at least as good as any other moral framework</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nA lengthier, stronger version:\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n \t<li>A preferred moral framework obtains the maximum amount of great-making properties</li>\\r\\n \t<li>A moral framework is given greatmaking properties by its creator(s)</li>\\r\\n \t<li>God possesses the maximum degree of all great-making properties</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Non-Gods do not possess the maximum degree of all great-making properties</li>\\r\\n \t<li>There is only one God</li>\\r\\n \t<li>Therefore, God's moral framework is preferred to any other moral framework</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\nTwo key great-making properties here are omniscience and omnibenevolence, but others can be considered as well as established in the literature. Any person who is imperfectly informed is suspect in their ability to guarantee the correctness of any set of statements, and moral statements are a subset of statements generally. This would include not only all individual atheists, but indeed any possible collection of atheists and non-atheists. This defeats market-oriented theories of moral optimization as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice that this leaves the individual Christian on a somewhat equal footing with the individual atheist. The Christian's goal would be to follow God's moral code, which would make the Christian's goal better than the secularist's goal, but since no Christian perfectly obtains their goal it doesn't obviously follow that the Christian is morally superior to the secularist. It does obviously follow, though, that the Christian moral framework is preferred.",

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/UkN5wLDOLHMDqW0jCiQreP/Meet-the-unschoolers.html\\\">Meet the unschoolers</a> is a nice introduction to unschooling. It clarifies that unschoolers may be homeschooled or may attend another school at the same time. It introduces the distinction between unschooling and radical unschooling. It helps us understand why unschooling is mostly cool but not all cool.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/preschool/Pages/Helping-Your-Child-Learn-to-Read.aspx\\\">With traditional formal education</a> in the US, \\\"Most children learn to read by 6 or 7 years of age. Some children learn at 4 or 5 years of age.\\\"  <br/>Regarding one unschooled child, <em>Meet the Unschoolers</em> informs us \\\"By age 9, Ishaan could read and write, largely propelled by a need to engage on gaming chats and enter Google search words.\\\" Prima facie this is thoroughly unimpressive. It still might be that the level of literacy obtained by the unschooler was higher than the level of literacy described in the article on traditional education, but it's at least non-obvious which in turn makes any benefit from switching to unschooling also non-obvious.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In general, unschooling suffers from a \\\"dearth of relevant data\\\" much like <a href=\\\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p70-138.pdf\\\">many alternative modes of education</a>. It sort of comes with the territory. By virtue of being the normal thing, traditional education is better studied. By virtue of being the new or weird thing, alternative education is understudied. As such, traditional education becomes in some sense at least a safe bet.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Radical unschooling takes things to the next level. Ordinary unschooling allows children to avoid the negatives associated with traditional schooling, but it leaves open the door for parents to teach children as they see fit. In this way, unschoolers might benefit from having a highly educated parent construct a customized learning plan, or occasional use of parental discipline, and so on.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Radical unschooling eliminates the paternal role of the parent entirely. For me this becomes problematic. I'd love to have my concerns overturned by research demonstrating that radical unschooling is associated with improved measures of life success, but no such data exists. Instead, I'm left with the feeling that radical unschooling creates opportunity costs where parents fail to act in situations where they genuinely know better than the child does, and the child actually suffers as a result. One point of data is that children who never attended religious services became atheist at a significantly and importantly earlier age, or if they did regularly attend but then stopped regularly attending by age 13.

Also be sure to read the interpretive caveats due to the fact that the entire sample is a group of self-selected atheists.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>It seems to me that radical unschooling is most aligned to a <a href=\\\"https://my.vanderbilt.edu/developmentalpsychologyblog/2013/12/types-of-parenting-styles-and-how-to-identify-yours/\\\">permissive parenting</a> pattern, and permissive parenting is mostly recognized as not great parenting. Would radical unschooling involve taking your child to church, even if they don't want to go? I don't think so. What about making your child eat spinach? What about using physical restraint to stop one child from punching another?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In contrast to this anti-authoritarian paradigm, some parenting experts suggest the traditional <a href=\\\"https://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html\\\">authoritative parenting style</a> is generally good for development. Of course, the new cool thing is to use a carrot-only approach. No punishments, only positive rewards. However, you are allowed to forego carrots as you see fit. As an economist, a foregone carrot looks just like a stick to me. There are also these endless debates about what constitutes abuse in parenting. Obviously, beating your child senseless is a bad thing, but what about time out? Is locking a child in a room against their will coercion, abuse, or nonviolent and fine? It completely depends who you ask.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Given my Christian priors, I'm skeptical that a foregone stick is universally good. At this point I'm a fan of swerving traditional education and therefore I'm sympathetic to moderate unschooling, but radical unschooling looks to me like an entire abdication of a parent's natural and moral leadership responsibility.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I once heard <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_E._Wagner&amp;oldid=860126272\\\">Richard Wagner</a> talk about an economic theory of leadership which boiled down to a sort of leader-as-first-mover theory from a process economics perspective, in contrast to the drivel we see out of most business schools. It was one of the most brilliant 10 minute rabbit trails I ever heard him ramble on about and I wonder why he hasn't turned it into a paper. Market transactions almost never truly spontaneously obtain between buyer and seller as theorized in the neoclassical paradigm.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Wagner's theory only relates tangentially, but you can see how the parent would be the natural transaction-initiator in a situation where the child has no idea what's going on and hasn't even learned to speak or read. If there are any mutually beneficial exchanges to be made they will seem probably to originate with the parent's activity, not this sort of radical non-parenting approach.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "title": "Ramsey is Wrong on Debt",
    "date": "2018-10-28",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Dave Ramsey is a smart dude, but I disagree with him on a significant number of issues. A primary disagreement is on the issue of debt. We agree debt is often bad and mainline financial analysis ignores negative, subtle psychological and behavioral developmental impacts, but Dave goes to far by ruling out debt altogether.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>One issue is that Dave has a hard time identifying the psycho-behavioral premium people pay by engaging in these negative habits. In one case he claims a 12-18% <a href=\\\"https://www.getrichslowly.org/research-reveals-credit-cards-encourage-spending/\\\">premium for using credit cards</a>. People bag on him because he didn't include a citation, but the citation exists and <a href=\\\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/credit-cards-make-you-spend-more/\\\">it's from Dun &amp; Bradstreet</a>, a reliable source. Dave also notes social and even spiritual consequences from using debt. Again, I think he's quite right over a large field of debt uses cases, and even over the average use case, but not all of them.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Credit cards are easy targets because they easily fail on the math. Even ignoring the psycho-social, spiritual, and other side-costs from credit card usage, they are often, but not always, a financial mistake based on their interest rate alone. Many economists, as opposed to financial analysts, accountants, and so on, attempt to claim that there is no mistake when using high-interest instruments. They simply reveal high consumptive time-preference. This is a deep claim with a shallow answer: Sure, the consumer isn't irrational, but they are stupid.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>They are stupid according to at least two, and easily many more, standards: First, the same consumers condemns themselves along different time periods. When people complain about their own persistent poverty and realize that their use of credit cards are to blame, they often experience regret. This doesn't always occur but it does occur with high frequency. In the language of economics, these people are temporally myopic. Indeed, they will often pay for training to overcome such myopic perceptions and habits. I see value in Ramsey to the extend he fills this market gap by providing techniques like <a href=\\\"https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/envelope-system-explained\\\">the envelope system</a> or <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debt-snowball_method&amp;oldid=851784753\\\">the debt snowball</a>.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>A second way the person is deeply rational but basically foolish for the use of debt in some cases is that the person may be content with their own choices when they shouldn't be. This perspective requires certain normative assumptions which disquiets some academic economics, but they are seen as perfectly obvious in the mind of most people. Ramsey, myself, other financial analysts, and other economists would all agree that the use of credit cards or other high-debt instruments typically reduces people's long-term income. The moral perspective comes in when we say there is some moral obligation to achieve higher income or particular kinds of spending. I think we can do this in a few ways:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>If a person could give money to a charity which results in the saving of a human life and they choose not to, they implicitly or indirectly contribute to that person's death, or otherwise make an immoral, or morally sub-optimal, choice.<ol><li>Notice this is not an explicitly Christian claim.</li></ol></li><li><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parable_of_the_talents_or_minas&amp;oldid=861306277#As_personal_abilities\\\">The parable of the talents</a> indicates that wealth of a good person should grow over time.<ol><li>This should be balanced against excerpts of the Bible which indicate that real wealth is spiritual and that material riches are ultimately bad.<ol><li>Matthew 6:19–20</li><li>Matthew 7:16</li><li>Matthew 19:24</li><li>Galatians 5:22-23</li></ol></li><li>I reconcile these scripture by adopting a strategy of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earning_to_give&amp;oldid=846762241\\\">earning to give</a>. Under this strategy, then, it would be morally preferable to give more.<ol><li>Giving less is still giving and it need not be considered sinful, but it would be considered less-than-optimal.</li><li>I think the distinction between sinlessness and perfection is found even in the bible itself, where perfection is an even higher standard.<ol><li>The distinction is pretty clear to me in the story recounted in Luke 18 and Matthew 19. There, a man who has followed the commandments asks, \\\"Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?\\\" Notice that Jesus seems to indicate material giving can lead to spiritual treasure when he says, \\\"...go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\\"</li></ol></li><li>In the Old Testament the bible established the tithe of 10%. Some Christians believe the tithe is currently effective under the New Testament while others don't. If there is such a minimum requirement then it may be sinful to give less than some measure of income.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Under the moral weight of earning to give, then, the economist who defends the myopic consumer as rational is defeated. Ramsey is defended in some sense, but I think he's wrong in another sense. Ramsey is wrong in the plain sense that sometimes debt instruments increase long-term wealth. I also think Ramsey is wrong on his theology of debt.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Ramsey admits that \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiJn2wumvF8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=120\\\">100% of references to debt are negative, [but] none of them say it's a sin</a>...\\\" I agree that no reference to debt in the Bible say that it's a sin, however I disagree that all references are negative. Most references equate debt with slavery, but slavery in the Bible is a complicated concept. Bad people are considered slaves to sin, but good people are considered <a href=\\\"https://www.biblestudytools.com/csb/romans/passage/?q=romans+1:1-15\\\">slaves to Christ</a>. The idea that people can escape physical slavery is admitted, but the idea that people can escape spiritual slavery doesn't seem to be an option. Even regarding physical slavery, the bible says this in <a href=\\\"https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-21.htm\\\">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Are you a slave? Don't let that worry you--but if you get a chance to be free, take it.</p></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In the mind of Ramsey's listeners, to be a slave is to be cursed, but this doesn't seem to be the biblical position. Instead, the biblical position seems to be that some forms of slavery are good, and some are bad, but God can use any of those situations for his own glory. I think that is also more compatible with how people should treat the use of debt.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Ramsey acknowledges that some debt instruments are better than others because <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiJn2wumvF8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=230\\\">he won't call people stupid for getting certain kinds of mortgages</a>. This small concession is hardly the full-fledged support of certain mortgages I would give, but it's at least enough to show that Ramsey has contradicted himself and so his hard-lined, morally-backed approach to debt really is not so at all.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I think Ramsey's approach has another virtue, which is that it is relatively fail-safe. People are demanding a strategy to gain wealth from Ramsey. If Ramsey took the typically route of allowing debt he would have to say there is some risk of failure, but the expected result is a large gain in wealth. Instead, he advocates for a strategy which he thinks is basically fool-proof, although it's slower and results in less total wealth. Unfortunately, even that compromised result overstates Ramsey's strategic effectiveness. His approach is lower risk than the traditional approach, but it's not foolproof, it's not guaranteed to get you out of poverty, and no strategy is actually capable of truly removing risk from the pursuit of any level of wealth.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Let's look at just one debt scenario which doesn't modify Ramsey's formula much. Suppose I can get a mortgage which has a payment less than the rent I would otherwise pay. Taking this deal improves my monthly cash-flow and I also begin earning equity. In the extreme case where I can't afford my mortgage Ramsey would complain that I incurred a negative circumstance that otherwise wouldn't have occurred because \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiJn2wumvF8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=150\\\">100% of the foreclosures occur on a property that has a mortgage</a>.\\\" This isn't quite true. I would otherwise have failed to pay rent, and in fact I would have been even more likely not to pay rent because rent was higher than the mortgage. While failure to pay rent doesn't result in a foreclosure, that's just a technicality. Both failure to pay rent and foreclosure result in homelessness.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Related Articles:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>March 2017, <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/8-biblical-money-principles/\\\">8 Biblical Money Principles</a></li><li>January 2013, <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/5-lessons-from-dave-ramsey/\\\">5 Lessons From Dave Ramsey</a></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->",

    "title": "Liberalism, Homosexuality, and Social Media Intersect to Show a Little Truth in Stereotypes, Part 1",
    "date": "2018-11-26",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Stereotypes prove nothing, but it's interesting to think about where they come from. Without doubt, some originate as baseless memetic humor or malicious gossip, but others seem to stem from generalizations based on anecdotal or even proper statistical information. This latter category has some hint of truth within it, although in common discussion the careful treatment required to generalize a statistical findings are often misapplied.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>One useful <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stereotype&amp;oldid=870324888\\\">definition of stereotype</a> is \\\"an over-generalized belief about a particular category of people.\\\" We can immediately see, however, that what even constitutes a stereotype is subjective. All statistical statements are generalizations to some degree, and all statistical models are useful simplifications. To call something a stereotype then, academically anyway, is simply to state that a generalization has been carried out improperly. In common parlance, however, a frequent straw-man occurs, intentionally or otherwise, in which a generalized statement is called a stereotype in order to discount the generalized statement, even when the generalized statement is properly interpreted.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>For example, consider <a href=\\\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/negative-stereotypes-drive-opposition-gay-rights-sochi-olympics-74470\\\">this article</a> from 2014 entitled \\\"NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES DRIVE OPPOSITION TO GAY RIGHTS.\\\" The article gives a second-hand description of actual research. What did the actual research find?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>People opposed to gay-rights laws aren’t as concerned with whether sexual orientation is ingrained or changeable as they are with “beliefs that gays and lesbians violate important social codes of conduct,” the researchers write in the <em>Journal of Applied Social Psychology.</em> </p></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Where is the stereotype? The stereotype exists to the extent that people believe homosexuals necessarily engage in destructive behavior, but vanishingly few people actually believe that. That is not even what the researchers found. The researchers asked questions on a one-to-seven scale like \\\"Typically, gay men and lesbians do not uphold the value of self-discipline (e.g., self-restraint, resistance to temptation).\\\"</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>What this means is that the researchers asked the respondents to engage in statistical reasoning, and the respondents were not making absolute statements. If the respondents simply answered true/false, then the researchers could demonstrate stereotype by showing that, for example, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LGBT_stereotypes&amp;oldid=870039199#Sex_and_drugs\\\">20% of gay men</a> from central London gyms have tried meth, but a certain class of respondent indicates \\\"true\\\" for the question \\\"gay men in London typically have used meth.\\\" In that case the respondents would be over-generalizing, because \\\"typically\\\" indicates more than 50% of the time.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>However, the researchers demonstrated no such thing. They merely demonstrated that people who tend to see homosexuality as bad for society also tend to think that homosexuals are more likely to have engaged in drug use than the average individual. That statement is not only non-stereotypical, it is factually true. Skip down two paragraphs for the source of this factual claim and some related discussion.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>The problem is that virtually no one in academia nor the media want to ironman conservatives. It falls perfectly into place with a separate generalization that the government, academia, and media tend left and oppose Christians who tend to be on the right. Notice, again, this is a statistical trend or generalization based on fact, not a baseless stereotype, although I certainly believe the statistical trend or generalization is often improperly voiced in common conversation to the effect that it becomes an inaccurate stereotype of extrapolation. Eg thinking university professors are necessarily liberal, which is absurd, but again, vanishingly few people actually think that. It's a straw-man.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Where is the source for my factual claim that homosexuals tend to engage in higher levels of drug use? The same source also shows that homosexuals tend to have higher levels of mental illness. The source comes from the government itself, the highest level of authority in the leftist mindset. Here are two links:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li><a href=\\\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/substance-use-suds-in-lgbt-populations\\\">Substance Use and SUDs in LGBT Populations</a></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-SexualOrientation-2015/NSDUH-SexualOrientation-2015/NSDUH-SexualOrientation-2015.htm\\\">Sexual Orientation and Estimates of Adult Substance Use and Mental Health: Results from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a><br/></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>The first link is a National Institute on Drug Abuse web page, and it refers to the second link for its own claims. Interestingly, the first source makes excuses on behalf of the LGBT population which are not found in reference paper's data. It states:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>People who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) often face social stigma, discrimination, and other challenges not encountered by people who identify as heterosexual. They also face a greater risk of harassment and violence. As a result of these and other stressors, sexual minorities are at increased risk for various behavioral health issues. </p></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In other words, the government source causally blames heterosexuals for the drug use and mental issues suffered by LGBT individuals. This is problematic because it's not what the researchers actually found, and it reinforces the story that the government, academy, and media are coordinating, whether or not they are doing so consciously. Here's what the research actually found:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Sexual minorities were more likely than their sexual majority counterparts to have substance use and mental health issues. The greater likelihood of sexual minority adults to have substance use and mental health issues compared with their sexual majority counterparts was observed across subgroups of adults defined by sex and by age group.</p></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>The journalist, not the researchers, state:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Not surprisingly, the researchers found that \\\"the more people perceived sexual orientation to be a choice, the more they opposed gay rights policies.\\\" ...In the minds of homophobes, if someone chooses to be gay, then he or she is also choosing to defy traditional values such as self-discipline and monogamy. </p></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>That's quite nearly correct, except for the malignment of socially-minded folks as homophobes engaging in stereotype. Ironic that the left identifies itself as the socially-conscious group and slanders the right as the privately concerned group. In this article, those opposed to gay rights laws do so in a properly conservative fashion, out of concern for the preservation of important social institutions for the stability and well being of society.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>As an aside, there's no such thing as a right to marriage of any kind, whether heterosexual or homosexual, and in the conservative mind the notion of homosexual marriage is an oxymoron. I digress.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I'm also not sure why the journalist thinks self-discipline is traditionally qualified value instead of, you know, like a simple, timeless, currently-applicable value.

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I think it’s possible for a person to be certain in their own Christian faith, but I also think it’s reasonable for a person to identify as Christian without needing to demonstrate that Christianity is true with certainty.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>More generally, I think it is valid to claim that a statement is true without needing to show that the statement is certainly true.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Christians are often asked by non-Christians, and also by each other, about how one might be certain that Christianity is true. I think probably the best answer is found within presuppositional apologetics, but this school of thought is not accepted by many people. A second approach, which I prefer because it follows a commonly accepted pattern of argumentation, is to argue that Christianity is rationally preferred even without certainty.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/odd-argument-belief-god-vandivierian-wager/\\\">Here's one of many articles</a> where I make an argument for Christianity without requiring certainty. Most arguments I make in favor of Christianity with optional certainty fall into one of two types of argument. First, if it is more likely that Christianity is true than it is likely that Christianity is not true, then it's rationally preferred to believe that Christianity is true, even without certainty. Second, even with a very small chance that Christianity is true, identifying Christianity as true is rationally preferred when the expected value of doing so is high, and that is always the case under salvation by faith alone, because of the payoff from obtaining salvation is high.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Suppose that we ignore axiomatic, necessity-grounded, presuppositionalist, and all other forms of argument for Christian belief with certainty. Let’s take seriously the calculation of the likelihood that Christianity is true while assuming uncertainty. I think there are two basic ways to get at this. Both involve what I’ve previously called <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/rational-estimation-price-uncertainty/\\\">ordinal logic</a>, and the discussion which follows is also under the influence of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability\\\">bayesian logic</a>. There is perhaps a sort of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Veil_of_ignorance&amp;oldid=871586602\\\">veil of ignorance</a> approach in some of the points made.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Start by defining the possibility set and stop before weighting any particular possibility. Assuming equal likelihood of any outcome, a first-glance probability is obtained. At first glance, Christianity is either true or untrue. Without weighting either option, these two options would be equally likely, and Christianity would have a 50% chance of being true.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>From the baseline at 50%, two different moves serve to increase or decrease the final calculation of the likelihood that Christianity is expected to be true. Either directional move constitutes one of the two ways to get at the question to which I earlier referred. One move is to count the number of successful arguments for and against Christianity. This move seems to strongly favor high likelihood of the truth of Christianity. A second move is to recognizing several omitted intermediate factors between a generalized truth of Christianity and a personalized, potentially unique, individual cost-benefit calculation. This move results in the observation of a significantly reduced likelihood that any particular Christian holds a true belief set.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>There are <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/religion/#bible-is-valid\\\">many good arguments</a> for Christianity, but let's see the mathematical impact of acknowledging even just one. If there is&nbsp; one good argument for Christianity, for now ignoring the number of good arguments against Christianity, there is a 75% chance that Christianity is true. A statement is expected to be more likely to be true when it is supported by a good argument than when it is not supported by a good argument. The likelihood of the supported claim will now be at least what is was without the supporting argument, and at best it is now proven with certainty. By way of expected value, then, (.5+1)/2 = .75.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In general, when we ignore the number of good arguments against Christianity and we include the number of good arguments supporting the notion that Christianity is true, the first-glance likelihood of Christianity is the chance that Christianity is true is 1 - (.5^(n+1)), where n is the number of arguments in favor. Now notice that every good argument for has an equal power to every good argument against, so that we can use the same formula above and redefine n as the net number of arguments in favor. With n of 5, the chance Christianity is false is about 1.6%. In the real world, I don’t know of any good arguments against Christianity, and I know of many more than 10 good arguments for it, so I think a 5 is very conservative value for n.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Now let's calculate the result of the move in the opposite direction, generating a worst-case, but still plausible, calculation of the likelihood of the truth of Christianity. The approach here is to recognize that Christianity being true is insufficient to yield a complete cost-benefit calculation for a particular Christian. Christianity writ large includes a diversity of beliefs. Many of these differences are unimportant for the purposes of cost-benefit calculation, but in a few cases the differences are critical.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Interestingly, that dogma which is often considered essential or critical from a theological perspective is often different from that dogma which is critical from a benefit-cost perspective. For example, the death and resurrection of Christ is essential under most approaches to systematic Christian theology, but a cost-benefit analysis obtains without regard to whether Christ died in a literal way, a metaphorical way, a physical way, a spiritual way, in accordance with modern medical definitions of death, according to ancient Jewish legal definitions of death, or at all.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Salvation theology, on the other hand, is critical to cost-benefit calculation. If an individual is not identified as eligible for the payoff from salvation, that individual faces a drastically reduced incentive to prefer Christianity over other worldviews. Likewise, even if an individual is considered eligible for the payoff from salvation, if the payoff itself can be identified as finite or small relative to some alternative payoff from a mutually exclusive worldview, the individual under consideration faces an incentive to rationally prefer the non-Christian worldview.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>To perform a concrete calculation, the truth of the doctrine of salvation by faith alone is considered critical. It doesn't need to be the case that identification of an individual as eligible for payoff is considered a distinct factor from the factor representing the chance of the truth of salvation by faith alone, but we will grant it as a second distinct factor in order to ironman the anti-Christian view. A third factor is the chance that the payoff is infinitely large.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Given that each of these factors have an independent chance of being true at 50%, multiplied by the chance that Christianity itself is true, the result is obtained. The result is that there is about a chance of 6% that not only is Christianity true, but the specific theological approach outlined previously is true, yielding an end-to-end cost-benefit calculation.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Notice that the specific theological approach outlined previously is actually a preferred theological set in real-world Christianity. One would expect that the preferred theologies among Christians and expert Christian theologians would be more likely then there are alternatives, not co-likely. This means that a reasonable estimate of the likelihood that Christianity is true would be greater than the 6% noted previously. This reasonable estimate becomes even more favorable toward Christianity if the number of factors is reduced from 4 to 3 by consolidating individual identification as eligible for the salvation payoff into the salvation theology factor itself. Under this more favorable calculation the likelihood that Christianity is true comes out to .5(.75)(.75) = .28.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In summary, when opposition to Christianity is ironmanned, it remains difficult to argue that the probability that Christianity is true is less than 6%. The expected value of preferring a Christian worldview remains comparably preferred to other options even with this 6% result. Alternative calculations identify a 98.4% chance of Christianity being true as a conservative number. The cross-approach average, then, is in excess of 50%. This indicates that it is more reasonable to expect that Christianity is true than it is reasonable to expect that Christianity is false, even before multiplying by expected payoff, and even when arbitrarily ruling out the many good arguments for Christianity with certainty.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>See the recording of the debate <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq51l_QCUn8\\\">here</a>. Comments were preserved from the chat! <ol><li>I was unable to see the chat during the debate. Dan and I ended up asking each other questions instead of taking audience questions.</li><li>Here is <a href=\\\"http://www.afterecon.com/philosophy-religion-and-apologetics/the-great-debate-on-morality-opening-remarks/\\\">a written outline of my planned opening remarks</a>. I think the written outline is clearer than what I actually said.</li></ol></li><li>Dan seemed to agree with my definitions of Christianity, morality, and secularism.</li><li>There was some confusion on the thesis. Dan granted the proposition that I was arguing for, \\\"Christian morality is rationally preferred to secular morality,\\\" either could be true or actually is true. <ol><li>I argued that if God exists then his morality is preferred, but that even if God doesn't exist the Christian ethic might cause flourishing and therefore be preferred even on the secular view.</li></ol></li><li>Dan's view of my thesis, which I proceeded to also attempt to defend, was as follows: \\\"Morality comes from God.\\\" <ol><li>Dan didn't refute any of my arguments for God's existence.</li><li> argued that I don't need to know how morality comes from God to know that it comes from God, but that God may have provided morality into our mind through evolutionary biology.</li><li>Dan admitted that Moses might have directly received morals from God on Mount Sinai. </li></ol></li><li>Dan argued that the God of the Bible might be an evil God because of the sacrifice of Christ, <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Binding_of_Isaac&amp;oldid=888275775\\\">the binding of Isaac</a>, Noah's flood, the slaughtering of the worshipers of the golden calf, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and more.<ol><li>I argued that if God is evil then he must exist, and that some objective standard of morality must therefore exist, but also that God can't be evil by definition because I define good as God's nature. Dan called this cheating, but I effectively criticized the moral standard he put forward as an alternative.</li><li>I pointed out that scripture says Noah's flood came because <a href=\\\"https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm\\\">people, except for Noah, were evil</a>, and that killing evil people could be a good. I asked why Isaac's death would be bad if Isaac were to grow up to be a serial killer. Dan responded by saying the future is uncertain, but I noted that the future was not uncertain to God, God can reveal with certainty, and only a revelation from God would provide a good reason for Abraham to do such a thing.</li><li>I defended the point that sacrifice can be a good, and even that the use of force can sometimes be a good. Dan disagreed with my definition of sacrifice. </li></ol></li><li>Dan turns out to be a moral objectivist and moral realist. He seemed to agree with the Harrisian idea of the moral landscape, even while acknowledging criticisms of it. This view indicates that human flourishing is identical with moral good. I criticized this view four ways: <ol><li>Referring to the <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YKkYU5W-IM\\\">William Lane Craig knock-down argument against Sam Harris</a> on the basis of psychopathy. <ol><li>I didn't do this argument justice, but I did mention it. I think a similar argument can be made using rape: <ol><li>Define flourishing as optimal human growth rate</li><li>Rape does or might increase the birth rate and thus the human growth rate</li><li>Rape does or might be morally good on the Harrisonian view, but it's clearly evil</li><li>Therefore, the Harrisonian view cannot establish a preferred moral framework  </li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Even on the flourishing view, people plausibly prefer Christianity because it currently and historically causes flourishing to a greater degree than secularism at the individual and social levels. Dan seemed to accept this.</li><li>Reductio ad absurdum: The Breeding Machine. If maximizing population growth is morally optimal, should we not prefer quantity of life to quality of life? It seems like a non-preferred world where the world is full of people with quality of life marginally above 0.</li><li>Reductio ad absurdum: Death by Drugs. If maximizing happiness is morally optimal, we should all do drugs until we die. Clearly this is absurd. </li></ol></li><li>Dan criticized the New Atheists and indicated that he believes free will exists because he detects it in a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_belief&amp;oldid=872663983\\\">properly basic</a> / <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phenomenal_conservatism&amp;oldid=847160754\\\">phenomenally conservative</a> way. Dan agreed that the is-ought problem is a problem for the Harrisian view of flourishing-as-good. Dan also agreed that the pure materialist seems to lack access to important sources of truth like mathematical truth, and that the scientific method can't justify itself. I think <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP6NCNUZFoQ\\\">Dan may have been referring to William Lane Craig in stating this</a>.</li><li>I clarified that whether I should do something because it is good or because God desires it is a false dichotomy in my view. I think God wills human flourishing, and also makes human flourishing possible and coherent by providing a purpose to human life. In my view human flourishing is maximal attainment of human purpose, but this depends on the existence of human purpose which depends on an intelligent creator. A mindless, naturalist origin would seem to imply the lack of any purpose.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "title": "20 Angular Quality Guidelines",
    "date": "2019-12-02",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Question to me: If you were going to conduct a peer review or put together a coding guide for well written angular code, what are some of the things you’d be looking for?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Answer:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Use pull requests for peer review. Prefer major providers like GitHub or Bitbucket. Use a process like <a href=\\\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\\\">Git Flow</a>. Attribute all pull requests to a requirement documented using a requirement ticketing system like Jira or GitHub issues. Ensure the business signs off on each release.</li><li>Automation-friendly rules. Use automated testing, prettier, tslint, and similar tools to ensure consistent quality with speed. Pull requests should automatically try to build the codebase, and broken builds should not be mergeable to dev. Dev should never be broken. Use a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint\\\">commit linter</a>.</li><li>Use <a href=\\\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\\\">semantic versioning</a> and automate your <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog\\\">release notes</a>.</li><li>Living rules which are intelligently defaulted but always open to change. Quality guidelines are for the benefit of the team, and the team should always be free to override any rule. Prefer teams of 3 or more developers with peer review or rule changes requiring two approvals in addition to the person who proposed the pull request or rule change.</li><li>Build regularly off of dev, and dev should never have a broken build.</li><li>Use feature flags to hide WIP features in production and facilitate A/B testing.</li><li>Try to adopt evidence-based rules. Showing a rule decreases the defects per sprint, increases velocity, or improves user analytics are examples of the kind of evidence I'm talking about.</li><li>Aggressively and redundantly log informative client and server errors. Build monitoring for this stuff.</li><li>Every feature should be tested with at least one end to end test. I like to include screenshot testing using Cypress with my end to end tests. 75% line coverage is a good high-quality starter watermark. Don't be afraid to drop to 10% or up to 100% depending on team risk tolerance or another good justification.</li><li>Make sure files and functions are uniquely named across the whole project. Variables should be uniquely named at least within the file, and their data type should be intuitive based on their name. Don't use ambiguous named like <code>value</code> or <code>data</code>.</li><li>Use a generic wrapper for <code>$http</code> to allow for generic error handling, instead of calling <code>$http</code> directly.</li><li>Storybook is a great tool which can allow developers to aggressively commit code which is released only to Storybook and not into production code. Storybook can be shared with designers and product folks to allow better iteration and review without production risk.</li><li>Generate components and services using the angular command line tool. Create a module for every distinct route and lazily load them using a routing module. I like to use <code>--flat=false</code> so I get a folder which can be dragged and dropped from one angular app into another. Create a <code>CoreModule</code> which is a top-level module that holds any services which will be used in all routes of the application. An <code>AuthService</code> might be an example.</li><li>Alternatively, consider the <a href=\\\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\\\">atomic design</a> folder structure used by the <code>ngx-admin</code> <a href=\\\"https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin\\\">here</a>. You don't need the <code>@</code> characters in the folder names. Make sure your team is bought in to this approach as it's an alternate to the official style guide approach.</li><li>Go over the official style guide with your team and double check which rules you will adopt and which you will ignore. Go ahead and adopt them if you don't have a justification to deviate.</li><li>Respect the ecosystem network effect. This means, for example, prefer Bootstrap 4 over CSS Grid at the time of writing. Even though grid is arguably better tech, no one is using it. You should be using a grid system. You will also need a state manager, but it can be a simple Angular service if you prefer that over something like ngrx. Consider using component libraries like Angular Material.</li><li>Global styles are terrible, but prefer them over <code>ViewEncapsulation: none</code> which can have unexpected side effects mid-session for a user. Shadow DOM is better than globals, but make sure your browser support requirements allow it. Specifically, that would depend on whether you need IE support.</li><li>Each of these little tricks may or may not apply for your project, but talk to your team about using these cool things:<ol><li>Service workers and web workers</li><li>Angular universal</li><li>Prerendering / static build</li><li>PWA support with an app shell.</li></ol></li><li>In many cases it will make sense to have a mock server for development time. I like to set up a full-blown Express mock server which can respond with built static resources and mock responses instead of the usual proxy approach which is limited. If you end up having a UI project, an Express server, Cypress, and Storybook, consider using a monorepo pattern. A real express server is also more extensible from a mock server into a run-time server or middleware layer.</li><li>Prefer <code>scss</code> over <code>css</code>, <code>less</code>, or other options. Css-in-javascript is cool but you should really be thinking about <code>tsx</code> at that point. <code>Tsx</code> is super cool but it's not standard for Angular at this time. At this point in time I recommend you just stick with Angular CLI options like <code>scss</code>. If you really want <code>tsx</code> today you should really be asking if you want Angular at all over React. While it's technically possible, I strongly recommend you do not use React inside of Angular these days.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>This article first attempts to de-glamorize entrepreneurship and then lays out a path for advancement, the terminus of which would be entrepreneurship. I also cover a reason side projects are necessities for top performers.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Starting a business is expensive and risky. What's little appreciated is that even successful entrepreneurs often don't make that much money. Indeed estimates entrepreneurs earn around <a href=\\\"https://www.indeed.com/salaries/entrepreneur-Salaries\\\">66k on average</a>, while CareerExplorer gives a more pessimistic average of <a href=\\\"https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/entrepreneur/salary/\\\">around 43k</a>.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Small businesses are considered more stable and profitable than ordinary entrepreneurs. While there is large overlap, small businesses may include partnerships and even small corporations, which allow some economies of scale and risk sharing compared to a lone entrepreneur. <a href=\\\"https://www.fundera.com/resources/small-business-revenue-statistics\\\">According to Fundera</a>, in 2018 the average small business owner made $72k per year, and over 86% of small business owners made less than $100k.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Entrepreneurship is clearly more lucrative than some jobs, but it's also clearly less lucrative than what I would call a good job. I consider IT jobs good jobs. Software engineering, digital design, product management, and professional Agile roles are some examples of the IT jobs I have in mind. I firmly believe anyone of average or better intelligence, regardless of their training, background, personality, and so on, can find a good fit in one or more of these roles.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I think business analyst would probably be the lowest paying among the good jobs I just outlined. Average base salary is about <a href=\\\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/us-business-analyst-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,19.htm\\\">$68k in the US</a> according to Glassdoor. This is a junior level position and within 5 years a candidate may be considered a Senior Business Analyst making an average base salary, before bonus and so on, of <a href=\\\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/us-senior-business-analyst-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,26.htm\\\">over $80k</a>.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>As you can see, good jobs pay as much or more than owning a small business without the headache and risk. Don't get me started on software engineering, which easily doubles the small business owner's average salary with no risk and awesome perks. <a href=\\\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/177641/small-business-owners-satisfied-less-likely-feel-successful.aspx\\\">Small business owner job satisfaction</a>, despite all the perks of being your own boss, isn't any different than <a href=\\\"https://www.surgeforward.com/do-people-enjoy-being-software-engineers/\\\">software engineer job satisfaction</a>. It's also much easier to land a good job than it is to own a small business that lasts <a href=\\\"https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail\\\">even a few years</a>.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>So getting a good job is a better investment than becoming an entrepreneur, but we all know about the limitations of a typical job and some of us have an entrepreneurial itch. Plus, there is eventually a ceiling to corporate success. So what should we do? I say the answer is side projects and intrapreneurship.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>As a software engineer, side projects are not optional for top performers. They are required. Corporations are risk averse and you will not be able to play with the latest experimental technologies in most corporate environments, with some exceptions. It is relatively easier to dedicate some of your after work time and develop a side project. If it takes off into a money making product, that's awesome! It's entrepreneurship without the risk, because your main job is your main job and this is a side project not the source of your life's stability. Your skills will transfer into your corporate life and you will have a leg up on your peers because most engineers don't do this. Side projects can and should include open source work.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Intrapreneurship allows you to develop certain entrepreneurial skills with less risk. If you are able to shift a major policy at work you will also be improving your status within the organization. Just make sure to keep your intrapreneurial endeavors as a second-order interest after your main job. Social skills and networks are key to both the entrepreneur and the intrapreneur, but perhaps even more key to the intrapreneur. Don't burn bridges with your coworkers.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Now that you have skilled up and influenced up the industry you might be a Director at a major S&amp;P 100 company. You will actually know how top businesses do things and you already have several side projects going on which could plausibly be turned into businesses. You will likely have opportunities to get secondary paid work or partner or advise other small companies. You see? If you are going to start your own business, take the plunge from the top, with network, with knowledge, because it is the only way to go higher. Not from the vantage point of someone who simply didn't want to have a boss.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>You could also take a middle-road approach as a consultant. Consultants can optionally work as corp-to-corp, 1099, or otherwise technically operate as their own company. Be careful this is a financial win for you, though, it often appears like a win on the surface but net taxes, benefits, risk, growth opportunities, and so on, may pan out to be a loss. My preferred strategy at the moment is to work W2 and have real estate outside of my main job in order to get some of the tax benefits around having a business.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "title": "EQ Tactics from Six Books",
    "date": "2020-02-08",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I've recently been seeking to develop my EQ, communication skills, and social influence skill by reading six books. This article aggregates my main notes from those books, with a focus on specific applied tactics and actions learned. I read all of these books as audiobooks through Audible.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Radical Candor: Fully Revised &amp; Updated Edition, Kim Scott, 2019<ol><li>Rated 4.5/5. The book contains three groups of tactics:<ol><li>Be radically candid. This has a somewhat complicated meaning but it is a well-defined tactic, or perhaps a series of tactics.<ol><li>Radical candor means being direct, transparent, honest, and caring. Being caring here means to use empathy to try to understand the other person, desire a positive outcome for them, and to craft language in a way that is still honest but is tailored to respect and empathize with them.</li><li>Radical candor provides a four-quadrant framework for classifying behaviors, and gives tactics around how to move from one quadrant to another, with radical candor being the name of the ideal behavior quadrant.</li><li>Example tactics with respect to other quadrants include:<ol><li>If you are being ruinously empathetic, increase your willingness to challenge directly to obtain radical candor.</li><li>If you are being obnoxiously aggressive, increase your level of care for the other person to arrive at radical candor. Learning more about the other person and more heavily valuing their success relative to your own are two approaches to improving your level of care for them.</li><li>If you are in the manipulatively insincere quadrant you should be both more direct and also more caring.</li></ol></li><li>I appreciated that all quadrants were clearly ranked for business value. Radical candor is best, but it's better for business success and personal success to be obnoxiously aggressive rather than ruinously empathetic. In some ways even manipulative insincerity is better than ruinous empathy. This is because manipulative insincerity is an effective survival tool in a toxic culture, although it tends to continue propagation of that culture.</li></ol></li><li>Tactics on how to introduce radical candor across a team to create a culture of radical candor.<ol><li>I appreciated the blunt advice to the effect that if a team is resisting radical candor and insisting on a toxic work environment, the solution is to leave the company.</li></ol></li><li>Tactics around effective performance review and providing feedback.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Emotional Intelligence 2.0, Bradberry and Greaves, 2010<ol><li>Rated 3/5. General tactic is to embrace your emotions, notice them quickly, then adapt behavior to your environment to maximize individual and social success. While the intent of this book is a bullseye for my desired area of EQ training, it falls short of effectiveness in many ways.</li><li>It was nice that this book didn't advocate for silencing classic emotions like anger. Instead, it suggested that they have a proper place and time.</li><li>The book stood out to me because it comes with an EQ test which will actually measure change before and after practicing the book's recommendations.</li><li>It also provides specific training recommendations across four skill groups. I have yet to take the posttest, but I unfortunately have some technical concerns with their approach to measuring EQ:<ol><li>They use a linear scale of 1-100 instead of the usual IQ-like approach <a href=\\\"https://myframeworks.org/testmyeq/\\\">going up to 160</a>, with 100 being average and following a normal curve outward. This mathematically different treatment means we can't commute most numeric claims between the book and the academic literature. Fortunately, most of the directional claims still stand.</li><li>I've previously taken several EQ assessments including one at the link above, and I generally ranked above average, but in the EQ 2.0 assessment I ranked below average.It's possible the assessment is accurate, but that would ironically mean that my EQ has declined as a result of recent reading and training. It's a red flag in my book because the difference is directional, not just quantitative.</li><li>In fact I just re-took another one to check the theory of whether my EQ has declined, but it indicated my EQ had improved slightly. I'm not very confident my EQ has changed at all, but an increase seems more plausible than a decrease, in particular if I am to accept recent compliments given to me by my current manager.</li><li>The EQ test itself is constructed differently than IQ tests and other EQ tests. It uses a scale of 1-5 which is more like a personality test, although the book attempts to differentiate EQ and personality. The scales are highly concerning because:<ol><li>The extremes are implausibly labeled \\\"always\\\" and \\\"never,\\\" where the questions are such that virtually no one should ever pick them in order to be factually correct.</li><li>People tend to choose extremes on such scales. That is, the test is constructed in a way that statistically would tend to cause people to give untrue answers.</li><li>Using scales opens the test to gaming by choosing extreme answers. A more common approach is to provide qualitative, sentence answers and have the the test taker select among them. IQ tests also do not use scales, but work off of pattern recognition.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Another general problem in the book seems to be this assumption that all people are necessary emotional, and they are equally emotional. As a result, someone who considers themself rather unemotional is simply emotionally unintelligent and lacks self-awareness. Unfortunately, this is factually incorrect:<ol><li>Some people <a href=\\\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150818-what-is-it-like-to-have-never-felt-an-emotion\\\">genuinely do not feel emotions</a>, or feel them very weakly. It doesn't follow that they don't know the emotional state of other people.</li><li>Emotions can be consciously or unconsciously <a href=\\\"https://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/pubs/upregpos.pdf\\\">up-regulated</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/good-thinking/201406/are-males-and-females-equally-emotional\\\">down-regulated</a>. Empathizers can experience emotions stronger or weaker than the original target of empathy.</li><li>A common tactic of manipulative insincerity is to fake emotion or empathy, or to claim the lack of sufficient empathy when there is none. This tactic doesn't seem effective in a world where everyone feels similar emotion with only varying awareness.</li><li>Being able to up-regulate or down-regulate can be a skill, and choosing to down-regulate emotion can benefit productivity. In software, while trying to write code, being emotional is essentially a distraction. Choosing to down-regulate emotion frees mental bandwidth for considering logic operations which can be translated into code. Down-regulation here is a skill, and the choice to leverage down-regulation should be considered an act of high EQ, not a lack thereof. Considering down-regulation a lack of EQ essentially conflates skillful emotional regulation with a general lack of EQ.</li></ol></li></ol><ol><li>Here are some specific tactics I found helpful in the book:<ol><li>2 Emotional awareness tactics<ol><li>Watch yourself like a hawk. Literally picture yourself as a third party watching down on yourself. This thinking may cause you to think more objectively about the situation.</li><li>If you find yourself relating to music in a new or different way, pause and think about why. Sometimes connecting to music is a result of mood or emotion, so you may be able to uncover your mood or emotion by thinking about that.</li></ol></li><li>3 Self-management tactics<ol><li>Make goals public. It boosts accountability when you make your goals public, and it may work as a forcing function to make you re-think your goals into more realistic, specific, and better goals.</li><li>Sleep on it. If you are faced with a difficult situation, don't feel rushed or forced to respond immediately. Take some time, and perhaps even a whole night and day, to think about it.</li><li>Smile and laugh more. This simple activity will make others feel at ease and it also has a way of improving your own mood.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Get out of Your Own Way: Overcoming Self-Defeating Behavior, Goulston and Goldberg, 2018<ol><li>Rated 3/5. 40 chapters with a so-called usable insight in every chapter, but I would say only about half of them are actually usable, and many of them are only useable in some situations. At the end, there is real concrete value here, but you may have to sift.</li><li>Some example techniques include:<ol><li>Be prepared to explain anything even moderately complex in a few ways. If someone has trouble understanding what you say or how you feel, it's extremely powerful to explain by analogy, particularly if you can use an analogy from their own life.</li><li>Assume people want something in return. We see this all the time in the corporate world, and it affects developers too. I think this is a low view of people so I admit I have neglected it. I tend to assume people want to do the right thing, but assuming they want something in return may be more often correct and it would at least prepare oneself for worse potential outcomes.</li><li>Don't refuse to play the game (within reason...Like don't murder people or anything). This relates to point 2 above, and it's something which I admittedly have done from time to time. Concrete examples of playing the game include:<ol><li>Tit for tat on pull requests. If someone goes easy on you they are expecting you go easy on them. If they goes easy on you and you shred their code with change requests, even if you are diplomatic about it, they may feel irritated or betrayed. The trick here is to use your judgement. If they are introducing an annoying but safe pattern, maybe you should let it slide. If they are introducing a technical bug, that's not the time to let it slide.</li><li>Go heavy on the compliments. This is an example of playing the social game and it's a tip in common with virtually every book on this list. Do make sure the compliments are authentic. Don't tell someone their idea was great when you didn't really hear or understand it.</li><li>Aligning work to your performance review process. I like to do what's best for the customer and the business, and this often results in doing things that aren't well valued according to technical performance review standards at various companies. Part of playing the game is balancing between doing real work and doing work that will look good at performance review time.h</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>How to Win Friends and Influence People, Dale Carnegie, 2004<ol><li>Rated 4/5. The book contains tried-and-true, if simplistic, advice.</li></ol><ol><li>The central tactic is to never insult anyone and to use compliments to motivate and influence. The book recommends winning arguments by never having them. The book is perfectly concordant with the old adage that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all.</li><li>I agree this will absolutely win friends and influence people in some sense, but it also <a href=\\\"https://www.believeandempower.com/the-disagreeable-personality-as-a-success-factor/\\\">contrasts with the literature</a> indicating disagreeableness for success and innovation.</li><li>In general, I still appreciate the tactic, although I don't expect to always use it. I think his tactics are a great way to graciously end a disagreeable social interaction.</li><li>More specifically, if I find someone who is being emotionally or intellectually weak, stubborn, or unreasonable, I plan to leverage Carnegie's advice, but if I encounter someone who maturely tolerates, or even seeks disagreement, revision, feedback, refinement, and so on, has a bit of thick skin, and is more concerned with finding the truth than with receiving compliments, I think Carnegie's polite methods are a mutually damaging opportunity cost, a sloth for progress, insincere, and socially expensive. Admittedly the latter kind of person seems to be exceedingly rare.</li></ol></li><li>How to Analyze People: Analyze and Influence Anyone, Eric Skinner, 2019<ol><li>Rated 3.9/5. This book contains numerous, concrete examples of ticks and tricks that people commit consciously or unconsciously through body language and actual language. The book proceeds to indicate potential motivations or hidden meaning in various cases. This is hugely valuable, but the author appears to be a non-native English speaker and the writing simply doesn't flow well in many places.<ol><li>Physical or lingual mirroring is an activity that occurs when someone wants to build rapport. You can use mirror testing to check whether another individual is interested in building rapport with you. One way to test this while sitting at a desk would be to put your elbows on the table, continue conversation as normal, and see whether the other party also puts their elbows on the table over the next 10 seconds or so.</li><li>Feet pointing in some direction indicate focus or desire to go some place. If they are pointed at you, you have their sincere attention. If they are pointed at the door, they may want to leave. If they are pointed at another party during a multiparty conversation, they are primarily interested in the other person.</li><li>Some tells are obvious and well known. A clenched jaw or fidgeting may indicate stress. Heightened eyebrows indicate surprise.</li><li>One of my favorite tips is to tell an innocuous joke. Nothing objectionable. Then observe the response. Receptiveness to humor is considered a prerequisite to the desire for a social relationship.</li><li>Modulating directness according to how it's received is important. There's a good tactic in the book. The reason modulation is important is because direct action is high-productivity, but can irritate, while indirect action is the reciprocal, so neither strictly wins. One technique to reduce irritation from directness is to simply talk slower. Here are some other examples of indirect action, which can also be considered directness-reducing tactics:<ol><li>Careful word choice. For example, using bias-free, gender-neutral, or otherwise politically correct speech.</li><li>Talking around a subject. This can be used to bait a listener into bringing up the subject of interest.</li><li>Asking a question, then filtering on answers for a pre-selected answer. This can make the listener feel like it was their idea, increasing buy-in and reducing irritation.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The Manager's Path, Fournier, 2019<ol><li>Rated 4.3/5. The first few chapters were rather devoid of value in my opinion, much like an extended introduction that kept implying the later part of the book would be useful. It turned out to be true! In chapters 4-5+ this book really begins shining, although it doesn't end up contributing to emotional intelligence in my view.</li><li>The book adds to a programming and technology-focused sub-literature of the business management literature, seeming to follow after Radical Candor. This book does a great job of laying out specific technology roles in great detail, and beautifully articulates how to manage a very awkward transition from software developer to tech lead to engineering manager to senior manager plus through the executive level. I'm personally someone who eventually intends to be Director level or above in tech, so this was an extremely good referral from my manager to me.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In one of <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoJhK5kMc4LjBKdiYrDtzlA\\\">this guy's YouTube videos</a> he says a well-run real estate operation should result in nearly tax-free income. I've been extremely skeptical about that, so I've been reluctant to scale my real estate land-lording to a bunch of units. This article reports my personal experience, and the result is that, yeah, the YouTube rando was right. There's effectively no tax burden in my current situation as we will see below.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:table -->\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-table\\\"><table class=\\\"\\\"><tbody><tr><td>Year</td><td>Household AGI</td><td>Effective Tax Rate</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>38940</td><td>-1.85%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>76056</td><td>7.18%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>90836</td><td>7.42%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>154584</td><td>12.34%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>178548</td><td>13.9%</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>221023</td><td>15.56%</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>229206</td><td>13.57%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n<!-- /wp:table -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>As you can see, my household income went up but my effective tax rate was lower than it had been in years. I also got a tax refund for the first time in years.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>It's important to note that I didn't simply add ~8k of rental income. 2018 included a signing bonus of about 15k, and that was replaced with rental income in 2019. So I was able to reduce my tax rate by actually increasing my share of income attributable to landlording relative to the day job.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Based on this experience, I definitely continue to support investing in real estate. I also really support house hacking. It's common knowledge that house hacking is a great income earning strategy, but I now realize that it's just as good or better than regular landlording for tax purposes. With house hacking, you can divide your property into a self-owned portion and a leased portion and depreciate and write off a share of many of the regular expenses of the house.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>As a last note, I do recommend you consult a tax strategist for 3+ properties. I had a great experience with <a href=\\\"https://www.shoffaccounting.com/\\\">Shoff Accounting</a>. Check with your CPA, but it's likely that tax strategy can be written off as a business expense. It doesn't really hurt to get a consultation while you own fewer properties, but there just isn't much strategy to be had. TurboTax Live Deluxe is also suitable for 1-4 rental doors in my opinion.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "title": "How long should it take to find a job after learning to program?",
    "date": "2020-07-04",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I recently created an <a href=\\\"https://www.afterecon.com/programming/an-8-week-coding-curriculum/\\\">8 week coding curriculum</a>. Following the 8 week curriculum is a month-long continued self study and job prep period which yields a minimum experience of 3 months prior to the job hunt. How long should it take a typical student to obtain a programming job after completing this curriculum? How much can such a person expect to be paid? Because I don't have a substantial sample of people who have actually done this to study, the answer is basically speculative and intuitive, rather than data-driven. Even so, I will speculate on such in this article.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.afterecon.com/programming/an-8-week-coding-curriculum/\\\">A 2018 article from Dice</a> indicates that about 12% of bootcamp graduates did not obtain a job within a year after attending a bootcamp. In my book, the bootcamp has no right to any claim of credit in such cases, even if an individual eventually does obtain a job. I would award the bootcamp no causal power in such cases.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>About half of the bootcamp graduates in the Dice article were already employed full-time as developers before entering bootcamp. For these folks, the bootcamp was a career acceleration or upskilling experience, not a career enabler. That's a great thing to do, but I exclude this from my population of interest.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Given a population proportion of 12/50 graduates without prior full-time experience failed to ever obtain a job, roughly speaking, this would provide about a 25% fail rate. That is a 75% chance of obtaining a job within the first year.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>About 50% of individuals would be able to obtain a job within the first month after graduation, another 20% would obtain a job within three months, another 10% within six months, and the remaining 10% would take longer than six months but less than one year.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>There are various caveats in applying this data to my personal mentorship outcomes:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>They actually have data and large samples.</li><li>In the above SO data, some of those who \\\"Haven't gotten a developer job\\\" may have stopped seeking or may not have been seeking in the first place.<ol><li>Some may have gotten four or five months out in the job search and decided that working as a designer, product owner, or something else was preferable, or <a href=\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2016/10/28/11-careers-you-can-land-after-attending-a-coding-bootcamp/#62951b0d4a38\\\">perhaps they had that orientation before even enrolling</a>.</li><li>Personally, none of my current students plan to look for a job immediately following graduation. Two plan to look after the Christmas holiday and one plans to enroll in and complete a Master's program prior to entering the job market.</li></ol></li><li>I charge in <a href=\\\"https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2020/\\\">the bottom 30% of bootcamp prices</a>, and typically lower price is associated with weaker outcomes.</li><li>Because bootcamps vary in duration, and they have varying entry requirements, graduates will have varying levels of experience upon graduation. That is, much of the above job placement pattern can be explained by years, or months, of experience in the field, rather than the bootcamp itself.<ol><li>Of note, I've seen some bootcamps require you to have basic programming competency to enter the bootcamp. I don't share this requirement as I am interested more in the field entry space rather than the career acceleration or upskilling space at this time.</li><li>In general, my student admission requirements seem to be on the low end of the bootcamp space. As a result, one might expect lower success after graduation, because success is in part explained by quality student selection instead of quality training.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>For the above reasons, an objective analysis would predict that my students would have substantially weak outcomes compared to bootcamps. On the other hand, I'm fairly confident, perhaps overconfident, in my skill as a programming teacher. As a result, I'm nearly willing to guarantee outcomes equivalent to the typical bootcamp graduate.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Nearly willing to? What's the difference then? The difference is that I don't expect the immediate job offer statistics to be so high. I don't have a series of guaranteed hire contracts lined up. I think most new-to-the-field candidates will fail at least a few interviews before having a successful one, and I think a reasonable pace of interview is one per week. In short, I don't think my typical student should expect to be hired within the first month of job search, even at a rate of 50%. See below for my clear timeline expectations.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>The form of my guarantee isn't meant to imply certainty. I'm loathe to claim certainty in anything, including whether the sky is blue. Instead, it's simply meant to imply that I'm confident enough that I'll put my money where my mouth is. To reiterate, I claim that:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>A student will achieve an offer of recommendation if:<ol><li>The 8-week coding curriculum is achieved with satisfaction. This will be true for the average student and, if not true, will be disclosed at the end of the 8 week period.</li><li>The student completes 4-6 additional weeks of self-study to the satisfaction of the recommender. The average student should expect a passing recommendation if they are completing at least 4 hours each week of dedicated programming, job prep, and other sorts of related study.<ol><li>If the recommender has an issue, it should be communicated no later than the week following the week in which it is observed. The student should not arrive at week 4 and learn about an issue the recommender perceived in the work for week 1.</li></ol></li><li>The student begins seeking a job in earnest within two weeks of receiving a recommendation. If there is some hiatus, the recommender may require the student to conduct a refresher of some sort.</li></ol></li><li>A student who obtains a recommendation and begins seeking a job in earnest should expect:<ol><li>Submitting 6-12 applications per week.</li><li>Conducting at least one interview or phone screening per week, beginning in the second week.</li><li>50% chance of a job offer within the first 3 months if the above two items are satisfied.</li><li>75% chance of a job offer within a year, provided that items 1 and 2 are satisfied.</li><li>A reasonable entry-level salary for the market in which you are applying.<ol><li>In Alexandria, VA, I would say a reasonable entry-level salary right now is $50,000 or more.</li><li>I calculate this salary from <a href=\\\"https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Front_End_Developer_%2F_Engineer/Salary/3f66d402/Entry-Level\\\">Payscale information</a> for an entry-level front end developer in Alexandria, VA. They state that the 10th percentile in salary realizes a salary of $40k and the median is $60k, so I averaged those numbers to get what I call a minimum reasonable salary.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>What do we mean by seeking a job in earnest? Admittedly I could be more clear, but here are five good indicators:<ol><li>Willing to consider relocation or accept local job prospects; for some areas this may indicate lower wages or no opportunities at all.</li><li>Submitting multiple applications per week. Perhaps 6-12 per week.</li><li>Willing to work with a recruiter.</li><li>Willing to continue portfolio improvement, skill development, and practice interviews during the application period.</li><li>Not rejecting any offer of employment for any reason other than salary.<ol><li>I fully respect that some people may not want to work for certain employers for ideological reasons, or they may have a poor culture fit, strange scheduling complications, and so on.</li><li>Feel free to reject the employment offer and know that I have nothing against your decision. However, from the point of view of my educational guarantee, I will consider my part of the bargain satisfied, the education effective, and I will maintain my fee. I may still be happy to delay the date the fee must be paid until a preferred job is found. Please contact me and we will sort it out.</li><li>On the other hand, if you do get an offer with an unreasonably low salary offer, I will not consider the contract satisfied. Should you choose to accept the offer, I will then consider the contract satisfied. Should you not choose to accept the offer, the guarantee will continue to remain.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>My confidence in the above claim is reflected in a guarantee, which provides that:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>If a student can't obtain a job within a year of earnest seeking, I won't charge them.</li><li>I will try to be as transparent about graduate and job placement data as possible without risking student identity exposure.<ol><li>That is, if this guarantee keeps flopping I will change the claims to better align with outcomes.</li><li>If outcomes show that the guarantee is too easy mode I will make it more ambitious. I would probably also increase my fee accordingly.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Disclaimer: The prior article is an overview of my current expectations and the way I've done some things in the past.

    "title": "The Names of My Children",
    "date": "2021-01-11",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I have two kids with my wife, Christina, and I wanted to jot down their name meaning. My first-born son is Samuel Luke Vandivier and he is 2 years old. My second-born daughter is Ellie Marie Vandivier and she turns 6 months old later this month.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>My wife and I are intentional about not choosing a name that is identified with a family member. We want to avoid imprinting an identity or role model person other than Jesus. We intend the name to convey our hopes for the child. As much as I love my family, I think it would be negatively constraining to hope that my child turns out like some particular member of our family. Removing names of living relatives eliminates John, Matthew, and Mark.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Luke was chosen because it was an available Gospel book. The middle name is intended to highlight that we hope he holds the gospel dear. The many other peculiarities of Luke, such as the fact that he was a doctor and it was an orderly account, were not intended by us but perhaps they can be seen as a providential selection.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>We were intentional about choosing one New Testament name, ideally a Gospel name, and one Old Testament name, to drive home the importance of the whole Bible. I preferred Lucas, the Greek form, and I wanted to select a Hebrew Old Testament name in order to emphasize the message that there is neither Jew nor Gentile in Christ, but many of the Hebrew names sounded admittedly strange and we were mindful not to give our kids names which are too outlandish. Negotiation with the wife supported the English variants.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Samuel was selected in part because I wanted a Levite name. A priestly name to signal the dedication of my firstborn to God. Tina felt connected to Hannah because Samuel was born out of prayer and miracle to Hannah. Tina and I had a miscarriage during our first pregnancy. Samuel was born from our second pregnancy, and we consider him a miraculous answer to our prayers against miscarriage. Tina also felt that the name just sounded right. She was partial to it even before she could tell the biblical story of Samuel from memory. Tina's perspective on Sam's name is detailed <a href=\\\"https://itstartedwithamiracle.wordpress.com/2018/10/04/how-we-picked-our-baby-name/\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I am particular to the name Samuel because this is the prophet who warned against Kings and favored the Old Judges. This can be read to communicate favor to Christian Anarcho-Capitalism and opposition to monopolistic human statism.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:separator -->\\n<hr class=\\\"wp-block-separator\\\"/>\\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Ellie Marie is named in such a way as to pay respect to both family lineages and the bible without specifically matching identity with a particular person. Tina is ethnically Jewish, and since this ethnicity is passed down maternally it means that Ellie's children will continue the lineage. Tangentially, I get to joke that my son is a redheaded jew.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Marie is a family middle-name in Tina's family, going back to the first Christian ancestor in her Jewish lineage. There were other Christians earlier elsewhere in the family tree, but not along the singular matrilineal line. Four generations back, in Poland, Tina's great-great-grandmother converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism. Her name was Sabina Marie Grzesozeck. She was born with the middle-name of Marie even before she was Christian! Of course, Marie contains a reference to Mary which is a deeply Christian name, highly valued in the Roman Catholic church, and representing a multitude of values which for Tina and I can be collectively surmised as characterizing a biblical woman. Sabina's female descendants have all had the middle name of Marie and we continue this to honor Tina's family line.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Ellie is a name with three intended meanings and a possible fourth providential meaning. First, the relation to my family line: My grandmother is <a href=\\\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1883837/\\\">Marijane Vandivier</a>. I asked my family to help brainstorm names with the only key intended meaning from me being the hope that Ellie would get along well with Sam. Marijane suggested some names and was most partial to Elizabeth, the name of her favorite sister. I wouldn't want to name my daughter after this particular person, but the name Ellie pays homage to Elizabeth while at the same time not being the same name. I also wanted to avoid Elizabeth because it is an English name, not a biblical name, and makes me think of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elizabeth_II&amp;oldid=999013738\\\">Queen Elizabeth</a> and several other women named Elizabeth of which I'm not terribly a fan.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>So Ellie is in part a reference to Elizabeth. It is also the shortened female form of two biblical names: Elijah and Elisha. Elijah is a major prophet in the Old Testament. Elijah means \\\"My God is Yahweh\\\" and he fought against Baal worship. Elisha means \\\"God is (my) salvation.\\\" Elisha succeeded Elijah in prophet lineage. So Ellie is meant to capture these hopes, that Ellie will follow Yahweh and find salvation through God.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Unintended is that Ellie can also be taken as a female form of Eli, the prophet who oversaw Samuel. Kind of weird to think a younger sister might be a mentor in some respect. That was not intended but hey, it may happen. I would love for Sam to grow up with a mindset that he can learn from, not just teach, his younger sister.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

Some of these systems proxy expertise by the number of times a word comes up within a resume. So do include a skills section on your resume, do use keywords for skills that employers care about within each experience entry for which it's relevant, and do have an objective statement that spells out the role you are looking for appended with \\\"or similar\\\".</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Think about obtaining an interview as a numbers game. You improve your odds of landing an interview by casting a wide net and applying to many roles. Do this by essentially ignoring job requirements and by applying for a wide variety of job titles. As a career-switcher, do not apply for senior roles, but also do not restrict yourself to junior roles. Having learned JS, HTML, CSS, and React, look for these job titles at a mid or junior level, and don't shy away even if they are asking for 2-3 years of experience that you lack:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>React Developer</li><li>Web Developer</li><li>Frontend / Front-end / Front End Developer</li><li>JavaScript Developer</li><li>UI developer</li><li>UX developer</li><li>Software Engineer</li><li>Software Developer</li><li>Angular Developer<ol><li>Note: During the application and interview process, be careful not to label yourself as an Angular expert unless you can prove it is the case in a technical interview. Instead, simply communicate that you are proficient in React. Many employers will be happy to hire such a developer and let them learn Angular on the job.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Note that the above job titles will vary slightly in meaning and in the amount that they typically pay. Search Google and familiarize yourself, but also know that you will be qualified for any of those roles if you have skill in JS, CSS, HTML, and React. In addition, React roles will generally pay the most. In current US dollars, depending on market, you can typically expect 60-80k for an entry role with one of the above titles.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Use tests and certificates from LinkedIn, PluralSight, Codecademy, HackerRank, and others to validate your technical skills. Let these established brands do your marketing for you. You can maintain a humble demeanor and style while pointing out that all of these other providers consider you proficient or expert in certain skills.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Peruse job descriptions, Glassdoor, PayScale, and similar web resources in order to dive into specific technologies and skills that employers care about, beyond those already mentioned. Note that employers also highly value soft skills like communication ability, teamwork, passion, and so on. Employers also care about your volunteer experience.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Use prior experience to highlight soft skills and programming-adjacent technology skills that may carry over or indicate you are familiar with how information technology works. For example, if you come from a marketing or communications background you may have experience with digital ads, click-through rates, counts of page views, search ranking, and other things that web developers do also care about. Just working in the same industry is a big deal too. If you are applying to Capital One as a developer and have experience as a bank teller, it's very much worth mentioning. Try to use your resume to highlight if you are a <a href=\\\"https://www.diversityjobs.com/2019/12/what-is-diversity-recruiting/\\\">diversity candidate</a>, perhaps by mentioning club involvement.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>The key is to leverage volume and probability. It's a numbers game. For career switchers, it is common to require 10-20 interviews before getting a quality offer, perhaps in addition to one or two crummier offers. Resist jumping at the first offer, and know that it may take 100 or more applications to generate 10 interviews. Set a goal of applying to 10-50 companies per week, depending on how urgently you need a new job and how able you are to schedule multiple interviews each week.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>Utilize Purpose-Built Job Tools</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>There are plenty of general-use job boards, like Indeed or Monster.

These are numerous and tedious. You will rarely get called if the only thing you do is apply this way, but it's a power combo to apply this way and then reach out via social media to someone who works at that company. It will be easy for them to look you up in their company HR system after you have applied via their company-specific jobs page.

Referrals are by an employee to the company they work at. References are to somewhere else.</li></ol><ol><li>Obviously, if you already know people, contact them.</li><li>Meet new people through social media, <a href=\\\"https://www.meetup.com/\\\">meetups</a>, clubs, and conferences. Companies source tons of hires from programming-related meetups and clubs. These groups are extremely beginner-friendly.</li><li>Pay people for help, and ask them for a referral after working with them. Some people, such as myself, will mentor or tutor you for a fee, or even sometimes for free, and will give you a referral if you perform satisfactorily. Sometimes this involves quite a bit of work on your part and sometimes not so much. You might even be able to pay someone for a resume review and get a reference out of it.</li><li>You can also cheat and just buy a referral or reference using <a href=\\\"https://www.rooftopslushie.com/referral\\\">Rooftop Slushie</a>.</li></ol></li><li><a href=\\\"https://lunchclub.ai/\\\">LunchClub</a> is a great networking tool.</li><li>Schedule a mock interview.<ol><li>Recruiters are often easy to network with and can facilitate this.</li><li>You can also ping developers and ask for this as a way they can help you and the community for free, or you can offer to pay them too.

I'm a huge advocate of using a recruiting agency for more junior and even mid-level roles. I'm also a fan of Apex Systems. These companies can leverage existing relationships with employers in your favor, and they can also provide skill assessments.</li></ol></li><li>Magnetic marketing<ol><li>Employers are constantly searching for talent. Help them find and like you by not only having a solid resume, but by having a well-maintained LinkedIn, a GitHub, a StackOverflow account, a Twitter, and even a personal website or blog.</li><li>As mentioned elsewhere, make sure that your online presence everywhere communicates your brand and personal identity in the strongest way which is still fair and accurate. Don't call yourself a junior.</li><li>Keep your LinkedIn posts professional. You can relax a bit on Twitter and elsewhere, but people do check these things and the following will come back to haunt you:<ol><li>Attacking people anywhere on social media.</li><li>Excessively immature or obscene usernames. Note that a little humor is fine and even encouraged.</li><li>Having a StackOverflow account with 0 points or a GitHub account with no repositories.</li><li>This one is minor, but try to have quality content on your GitHub. That is, don't just clone practice applications. Do provide intelligent commit messages. Do try to actually write quality code.</li></ol></li><li>Take the time to get a great headshot.</li><li>Ask people to give you feedback on these other elements of your online presence, in addition to the resume.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>What About After Getting an Interview or an Offer?</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Try to resist jumping at the first offer. I like to see candidates receive three offers before making a decision, but urgency does understandably vary by individual. Do prepare for each individual interview by reviewing the company and the specific job description. Find a way to compliment the role, the company, and the interviewer during the interviewer. If you can't, maybe it's not a good place for you to be.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Don't be afraid to have employers compete for you, but also be reasonable, kind, and empathetic when communicating with them. For example, if you do have multiple offers, then try to communicate to each employer that you appreciate the opportunity for specific reasons, and mention the existence of the competing offer in such a way as to search for a mutually beneficial solution, rather than in such a way as to appear threatening or pushy. Don't be afraid to ask an employer to let you think over the weekend on an offer, and do try to give employers time to think as well.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I recommend you approach your first role with the purpose of removing your label as a junior. Once you have 6 months of industry experience, you will be able to stretch for a mid-level role by renegotiating or changing companies. Don't get too attached to your first employer. Do remain open to even a short-term contract for your first role. It could be a blessing in disguise because the short-term nature of such a role promotes your ability to renegotiate to a higher level or leave the company without guilt or a burned bridge.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Let's wrap up with some loose watermarks for advancing away from junior status. High performers may be able to obtain a senior role with as few as 2 years of professional experience and a mid-level role with as few as 6 months of experience. To achieve such rapid advancement, you will need to show high technical and soft skills when grilled during a technical interview, in addition to having the specified minimum time in the field.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>For average to below-average skill levels, aim for a mid-level role in 2-5 years and a senior role with 3-10 years of experience.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "date": "2021-05-16",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Those who read my blog will know that I am a fan of the Austrian school, with a variety of caveats including a preference for Hayek over Rothbard and a distaste for their distaste of empirical, microeconomic, experimental, and applied work. In two sections, this article covers some things I have recently learned about the Rothbardians, Hoppe in particular, which makes me like them even less. In a third section, I propose that the field of anarcho-capitalism should be dehomogenized in a manner similar to the dehomogenization of Hayek from Mises.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>I. Some Background</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I previously knew little of Hans Hermann-Hoppe. I received a certificate in Austrian Macroeconomics from the Mises Institute years ago, learning under <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_T._Salerno&amp;oldid=1018390207\\\">Joe Salerno</a>. Salerno is a leading proponent of the Austrian Dehomoginization Theory, which is the theory that the Austrian School is a label for several importantly different economic approaches. Specifically, Salerno distinguishes <a href=\\\"https://mises.org/library/mises-and-hayek-dehomogenized\\\">between a Hayekian and a Misesian tradition</a>. Notice the empirical nature of Hayek's argument:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>successful economic action...depends largely on the approximately correct prediction of future prices. These predictions will be based on present prices and their trends...Indeed the function of prices is precisely to communicate, as rapidly as possible, signals of changes of which the individual cannot know but to which his plans must be adjusted. This system works because on the whole current prices are fairly reliable indications of what future prices will probably be.</p><cite>Hayek, <a href=\\\"https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf\\\">Denationalization of Money</a></cite></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Hayek's empirical disposition bodes well for a synthesis with the Chicago School, and specifically with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Essays_in_Positive_Economics&amp;oldid=932914485\\\">the Friedmanian position</a> that economic models need not be realistic by construction so long as they yield correct results. Interestingly, this dissolves Hayek's alignment with Mises that economic calculation is impossible without prices.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Hayek might agree that it would be practically impossible to coordinate without prices, but he means this in the technical sense that it is overwhelmingly likely that a price prediction model with input prices would beat whatever other prediction models are available. All Austrians must recognize that <a href=\\\"https://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/short-essay-regarding-economic-coordination-within-mixed-ecology-enterprises-erasing-theoretical-antinomy/\\\">a first-stage economy has no prices</a>, so price estimates can be constructed without pre-existing prices. I think all of these pre-internet scholars would be surprised at the amount of data the internet provides and the precision of modern modeling including machine learning models. I think Hayekians and Friedmanians, although not Misesians or Rothbardians, would acknowledge the possibility and value of non-pecuniary models of price that empirically outperform price models of price.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Then there's always the scholarly defense of Mises that he was simply embellishing and he knew full well that when he said economic calculation without prices is 'impossible,' he simply meant that it was practically impossible. Fine, so then let the Misesians and Rothbardians embrace empirical work too, although what I actually see is <a href=\\\"https://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/some-austrians-cant-take-a-win/\\\">a loathing for empirical work among them today</a>.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>II. The Repugnant Fruit of Rothbard</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Rothbard made some good critiques and some bad critiques, and in his misguided criticisms he set out to reimagine economics on the basis of revealed preference. Here are some of his mistakes in my view:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>While I like an axiomatic analytical approach, he posits unjustified axioms, so the method is unjustified as well.</li><li>He betrays his own axiomatic preference by attempting to build a quantitative method using revealed preferences.</li><li>From revealed preferences, he rejects the possibility of genuine indifference, but this rejection is illogical.<ol><li>A quick proof by example: Given a horse dying of thirst equidistant between two oases, the horse will die if it fails to move and yet it has no preference among either oasis. A neoclassical could predict his choice with a probabilistic coin toss model and would be correct. A Rothbardian would be unable to predict the horse's choice, but after the horse made a choice the Rothbardian would claim the horse truly preferred A to B all along. At once we see the predictive failure of Rothbard and also the invalidity of drawn conclusions.</li></ol></li><li>His failed argument for axiomatic state malevolence. As an alternative, Hayek and Friedman argue for the expected inefficiency of the state in a non-axiomatic way that is compatible with Christianity.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hans-Hermann_Hoppe&amp;oldid=1022267208\\\">Hans Hermann-Hoppe</a> is a Senior Fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute and has an <a href=\\\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C47&amp;q=HH+Hoppe&amp;btnG=\\\">enviable publishing record</a>. He is also an anarcho-capitalist. These are all positives in my book. Only today did I learn that:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Not only is he a Rothbardian, but perhaps the leading Rothbardian today and a very close friend of Rothbard for years.<ol><li>I, therefore, consider him as a representative intellectual fruit of Rothbard. I think Hoppe and Rothbard would happily ascent to this labeling.</li></ol></li><li>Hoppe advocates for reduced immigration on axiomatic grounds</li><li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/PhilWMagness\\\">Phil Magness</a> has convinced me (weakly, but enough for concern) that Hoppe has some eugenic influence<ol><li>Hoppe writes that 'Negroids' have a lower time preference than Caucasians on average. Phil and others argue that this is evidence of pro-eugenics disposition.</li><li>While maintaining that I'm not Hoppean or Rothbardian, I demand a bit more evidence, postulating:<ol><li>The strange choice of words could result from a combination of Hoppe's age, non-native English speaker status, and political correctness in academia; a semantic grasping at straws to avoid saying something like 'blacks.'</li><li>Hoppe's correlation statement may well be true, depending on how he means the word and what data he marshals to that end.</li><li>Correlational statements and even causal statements of racial effects in academic work do not amount to racism.</li><li>Racism does not amount to eugenicism or nazism. It's particularly hard to imagine an anarcho-capitalist nazi.</li></ol></li><li>Further comments from Magness to address my concerns, which I take with worrying credibility:<ol><li>Hoppe uses the term because he endorses Rushton's eugenic text, which also uses the term as one of its primary categories of racial classification. He endorses Rushton's position in this essay and numerous other works, including Democracy: the God that Failed.</li><li>The word choice is intentional. It is explicitly drawn from eugenics, and is cited as such to an acknowledged eugenic text.</li><li>As with his David Irving quotations, this is an instance where Hoppe tipped his hand a bit too far and let his racism show.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>So now let's review the rotten fruit:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>A real anarcho-capitalist should find immigration laws repugnant. Indeed, even the average economist knows of the extreme value of immigration. Here, Hoppe veers away from what is normal among economists and, further, what is normal among anarcho-capitalists. Yet, it's not clear that he misrepresents Rothbardian analysis or culture.</li><li>The Rothbardian mode, in general, seeks axioms without empirical test; this whole approach is dangerous. When one makes a logical error, there is no means by which to identify the logical error, so the logical errors just go on compounding into truly absurd statements that defy and contradict even their axiomatic origins. A glimpse of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hans-Hermann_Hoppe&amp;oldid=1022267208\\\">some of the other crazy things Hoppe has said</a> outside of his empirically poor opposition to immigration:<ol><li>\\\"There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society.\\\"</li><li>The above quote defies the logic of even Hoppe's own covenant communities and the defiance is in a predictable manner: Such a situation is logically possible but by no means exclusively indicated, yet Hoppe feels no need to move from the logically possible into the empirically expected.</li><li>David Friedman provides a better analysis that incorporates incentives using price theory to show why such exclusivist covenant communities are both possible and unlikely in an actual anarcho-capitalist society. Specifically, such exclusive communities would be an expensive luxury good, and luxury goods are a small segment of the economy.</li></ol></li><li>The Rothbardian preference for axiomatic analysis fails to deal with the transition to anarchy, which is the largest problem for anarcho-capitalism in my view. Instead of a gradual transition to anarchy, Hoppe treats the situation as so logically different that the optimal policy regime changes, but the optimal policy regime he suggests will never bring about anarchy, so again we have:<ol><li>Internally inconsistent analysis</li><li>Analysis at odds with normal economic analysis</li><li>Analysis that fails to deal with important related theoretical and practical concerns</li><li>Analysis that, when applied, yields results that ordinary people find concerning on moral grounds. This is by no means a standalone criterion, but it adds importantly to the concern.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>III.

This problem extends beyond the Austrian school to all of economics, and to sociology, biology, and many other fields where ethnicity might take a right-hand position in a regression analysis. This is not an academic problem but a problem of popular scientific illiteracy and media clickbaiting.

I think the Friedmanian camp is closer to Hayek than the Rothbardian camp is in terms of economic approach, although perhaps not in terms of intellectual heritage. On the other hand, Hayek was very much engaged in conversation with Keynes and Milton Friedman, so perhaps they influenced his thinking as much or more than Mises. <a href=\\\"http://webhome.auburn.edu/~garriro/hayek%20and%20friedman.pdf\\\">In the 1980s, Hayek stated</a>:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Milton and I agree on almost everything except monetary policy</p><cite>Garrison, \\\"Hayek and Friedman: Head to Head\\\"</cite></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I think David Friedman may well have said the same thing. I certainly subscribe to the ideas of Hayek and the Friedmans over the ideas of Rothbard. While I'm a great fan of Menger I often take issue with statements from Mises. A core Misesian problem, though, is that he speaks in narrative and it's often not clear to me when he's embellishing and when he's speaking technically. So I give Mises a pass by the benefit of the doubt and I see a clearer dehomogenization between Hayek and Rothbard compared to Salerno's lucid analysis to which I'm still open. Yet, it seems to me that neither Hayek nor Mises were anarcho-capitalists, so I think Friedmanian and Rothbardian anarcho-capitalists offer the cleanest subcategory labels, and with important differences in analytical approach.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

This story reminds us that the common views of the day, even among specialists, are to be taken with a bag of salt.

Yet, I think if you simply surveyed women that went through hiring for SWE roles they would usually tell you everything seemed pretty fair (I think it would be comparable to male response, unsurprising to see it much less than 100% though).</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>One of the best arguments I've heard for \\\"Tech is Misogynistic\\\" + \\\"Guys in Tech are Sexist\\\" is the observation that 72% of women in tech (63% in sofware engineering + IT) report having worked at a company where \\\"bro culture\\\" is pervasive.<ol><li>Per <a href=\\\"https://www.trustradius.com/buyer-blog/women-in-tech-report#broculture\\\">TrustRadius, 2021</a>.</li><li>\\\"Bro culture\\\" is a pretty ambiguous term, and the survey did not use any particular definition, but the TrustRadius report links to a discussion on the term which in turn cites <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bro_culture&amp;oldid=1068154476\\\">the Wikipedia article</a>.<ol><li>In terms of negatives, there is thought to be some association with frat culture and sexual harassment.</li><li>In many cases the term is used in a neutral or positive way.</li><li>Bro culture appears to mean different things in different places. For example, Wikipedia above specifies that it overlaps with surfer culture in California.</li><li>Perhaps bro culture could be reduced by screening against candidates with a fraternity affiliation, a university degree, or even surfers. Perhaps CS degrees are particularly toxic in direct connection with bro culture. There's definitely plenty more here that could be interesting to study.</li></ol></li><li>Caveat: I'm not sure that all survey respondents are all US professionals and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JohnVandivier/status/1490080964202143744\\\">I'm not sure how the respondents were selected or recruited to participate</a>.</li><li>Note that this does not seem to indicate that most women have a bro culture at their current workplace, but rather that they have seen it at some time in their career.<ol><li>I think we can definitively say \\\"tech is misogynistic\\\" if most workplaces accept, practice, or allow misogyny or misogynistic behavior inclusing sexual harassment.</li><li>I do not think bro culture is identical to misogyny, although a correlation or causal association is intuitive.</li><li>I do not think that having ever seen bro culture in a person's career is a good measure of the percent of employers engaged in bro culture. The \\\"ever seen\\\" vs \\\"currently see\\\" problem <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JohnVandivier/status/1490088494777221124\\\">may also plague the Girl Who Code study, but I am assuming that it does not at the moment</a>.</li></ol></li><li>Note that 41% of men responded affirmatively to the same question, so:<ol><li>Men and women for the most part agree (eg .41/.72 > .5, and the share in common is even larger for SWEs in particular, estimated at .41/.63).</li><li>We can state that most women have seen bro culture at some point in their career, but we cannot say that most tech workers agree that bro culture is pervasive across the industry. I don't know of an accepted criteria of industrial misogyny that this would satisfy.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->",

It gives us a limited but informative, useful, and actionable picture of tech culture today.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Women face real issues with less inclusive employers, but more inclusive employers are equally common<ol><li>By investigating the top and bottom fifth of employers by inclusivity, the study essentially tells us by construction that less inclusive employers are no more numerous than more inclusive ones.</li><li>Even among the most inclusive employers, there is room for improvement. 85% of women in these companies love their job, which is strong but improvable. 15% of women in top companies have heard inappropriate remarks, which seems too high in my book.</li><li>There are many red flags among less inclusive employers, but also some results that surprised me because I thought they would be worse. In this bottom-fifth of tech employers, more than 1 in 4 women say they love their job. I would've expected it to be lower. More than half (54%) of women at these low-end employers say they have heard inappropriate remarks. This is a huge problem, but I don't consider it surprising.</li></ol></li><li>Senior HR leaders are more than twice as likely as female employees to say that it is easy for women to thrive in tech.<ol><li>A negative reading is that leadership is disconnected from female employee experience, but a positive reading is that many junior female employees underestimate their ability to progress through their career! Probably both are true to varying extents.</li><li>I think it is nice as a sign of positive intent from leadership. I think it seems preferable in contrast to the opposite scenario where female employees have high hopes but leadership doesn't think they will do well.</li></ol></li><li>More inclusive company cultures could drop annual attrition rate of women in tech by 70 percent, leading to 3 million women in tech by 2030!<ol><li>Parental leave changes are the single biggest effect contributor, and making these policy changes is straightforward!</li><li>Mentorship is another major gap here. <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JohnVandivier/status/1490169580358148097\\\">I think this is a place where male allies could be a huge value-add</a>?</li></ol></li><li>The diversity issue begins long before employment, with tracibility through college programs and into high school.</li><li>Actionable items to improve college culture! \\\"At the most-inclusive colleges, for example, at least 35% of the faculty in tech, engineering or math classes are women.\\\" I love this tip, as I think CS programs are a big stumbling block for girls interesting in coding.</li><li>The study shows many policy changes are win-win across ethnic, gender, orientation, and other lines.<ol><li>Specifically, improvements to inclusive networking, creativity and innovation, presence of role models, diverse leadership, and parental leave improvements are generally good for all people regardless of gender.</li><li>I think identifying changes that benefit multiple groups is hugely valuable because this can drive practical firm adoption and social unity for all people across group lines, instead of reinforcing group boundaries.</li><li>It seems to me that reinforcing collective identity boundaries, group-specific norms, group egoism, and similar values, tends to propogate sexism, racism, and other discrimination.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>8 Selected Criticisms</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Tech is not the Bottom Fifth!<ol><li>By focusing on the top and bottom fifth we do get insight into what makes a more or less inclusive employer - love that, but we get essentially no insight into what is truly normal in tech.</li><li>Compared to a standard exploratory data analysis of the whole data set, focusing on the top and bottom fifth is a dangerous practice that tends to exaggerate effects. Differences between the top and bottom fifth are much larger than differences between the average, normal, or median firm and firms in either the top or bottom fifth.</li><li>I would love to have Accenture and Girls Who Code publish a de-identified data set for reanalysis. Looking at what is normal in tech among both men and women is a major goal here.</li><li>For whatever reason, when these results were communicated to the public, the public narrative has very much become that tech is not inclusive, tech is misogynistic, and so on, essentially identifying tech norms as the findings in the botttom fifth! What an awful and inaccurate narrative!</li></ol></li><li>What do some of these figures actually mean?<ol><li>\\\"Have heard or read inappropriate remarks or comments\\\" - is this how the questionnaire was actually worded, maybe a simple yes/no? Can we see a copy of the questionnaire?</li><li>Does this mean at the respondent's current work environment, ever in their tech career, or was it left ambiguous?</li><li>It's a problem that 54% of respondents in bottom-fifth tech companies have heard or read inappropriate remarks, but it's importantly different whether that is on a per-career or per-employer basis. It's a much, much bigger problem if that is a per-employer figure as it would indicate inappropriate behavior is not only occassionally observed but it is in fact more common than not among such employers.</li><li>What is the content of these remarks? I think in pop culture many people will state that these are sexist remarks. As a guy, I could also state that yes I have heard inappropriate remarks or comments, but only a fraction of these would be sexist in nature, and zero of the sexist remarks that I've heard would have had a direct impact on anything tangible. (Once I found out that a manager had slept with a coworker, which is shockingly inappropriate, but I only found out after they had both left the company).</li></ol></li><li>The report lumps together misogynistic and non-misogynistic cultural factors<ol><li>Sexual harassment and sexual assault are a plague on this industry. In contrast, women who decide to stop working so that they can have more time with their children is not something we want to limit! Why on earth would you lump these into the same category?!</li><li>There is no \\\"other\\\" option (whether or not allowing fill-in-the-blank response). This is a real analytical problem and a source of potentially substantial omitted variable bias and foregone learnings.</li><li>Blame the pop culture consumption and media if you want, but their response is partially due to the communication of results within the report itself.<ol><li>By lumping together so many things under the umbrella of \\\"cultural issues,\\\" of course it became the number one correlate!</li><li>The report then framed cultural factors as a \\\"cause\\\" of women leaving tech by age 35, and women leaving by 35 was determined to be bad.</li><li>A more responsible analysis would break cultural issues into at least three, potentially more, subgroups: SA/SH, unregretted attrition (specifically around WLB and child-rearing), and regretted attrition (possibly breaking out WLB as distinct from other cultural issues).</li><li>We might think \\\"unregretted attrition is zero!\\\" Let's be careful about the implication: Do we want a society where both parents are always working full-time? No? Then do we want to foster a stay-at-home dad norm?</li><li>I think a mix is ideal. Some families have a stay at home mom, for some families it's dad, for some families both parents work whether part of full time, but I think it's bad if we optimize on \\\"all families have both full-time parents.\\\" Therefore, I don't think URA of 0 is appropriate.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>They didn't talk about the guys!<ol><li>Talking about non-females is necessary to identify female issues. Otherwise, you mistake general issues for female issues. Issue like work-life balance are major concerns for both genders, and shouldn't be taken as a sign of misogyny.</li><li>Thinking about male effects can be a useful tie-breaker to help priotizie among different things that are good for women.</li><li>Thinking about male effects can be a useful motivator at some companies that may have many male employees. Practically, it can increase the benefit value of any suggestion that gets pitched to leadership. Strategically, let's leverage our numerous male allies and create win-wins for both genders.</li><li>\\\"Likelihood of advancing to manager\\\" appears prima facie bad because it's less than half of women, but on second thought, do half of men advance to manager? How big is the actual problem here?</li></ol></li><li>There is no causal analysis<ol><li>Basically the results of this data include a large number of summary statistics and cross-tabulations by gender, but where is the causal analysis and the regressions? Causality is largely assumed.</li></ol></li><li>They miss out on suggesting some really good ideas.<ol><li>Their analysis shows the problem begins with college, so what about a recommendation that employers drop the degree requirement?</li><li>Again, because college is a key issue here, what about improved utilization of coding bootcamps? <a href=\\\"https://www.coursereport.com/blog/data-dive-gender-in-coding-bootcamps\\\">According to Course Report, in 2020</a>, 41% of bootcamp graduates and 49.5% of online coding bootcamp graduates were female.</li></ol></li><li>Show me the data: Where are the confidence intervals?<ol><li>They describe a cumulative effect, but it's not clear what this means technically.</li><li>Are they making a prediction?

    "title": "A Defense of the Timing of the Incarnation",
    "date": "2022-04-27",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>When discussing Christianity, one objection that sometimes comes up is the timing of the incarnation. This timing objection relates to broader objections both from the problem of hiddenness and the problem of evil. This article gives a fine-tuning defense.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>If Jesus had come much earlier, ostensibly more evil could have been prevented. If Jesus had come much later, ostensibly his life would be better documented, observed, and verified. We could have miracles on video!</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>One moderately traditional defense is an appeal to Old Testament scriptures. I think this defense is not necessarily wrong but it is weak, for two reasons:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>The fulfillment of prophecy is actually a red herring with respect to this specific question.<ol><li>Suppose God communicates a prophetic chain of A events to begin with event B in C years. We then confirm that event B occurs in C years; that is, the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, to a virgin, and so on. We now have good evidence that:<ol><li>God exists</li><li>Prophecies through God are a thing</li><li>The remainder of event chain A is expected to proceed</li><li>General support for the Christian religion, that ultimately sufficient to outweigh the objection from timing, albeit indirectly and only after added cumulatively to other arguments. We can do better.</li></ol></li><li>What point 1.1 does not give us is an answer to the question, \\\"Why C years?\\\" We can do better.</li><li>As a side point, many people have made many predictions by adding up prophetic years in the Bible, and many of those predictions have failed, so there's good reason to question an apologetic derived from prophetic timing.</li></ol></li><li>The Old Testament scriptures themselves are subject to more or less the same timing problems for more or less the same reasons.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>So my solution to this is to propose a fine-tuning argument. Notice that I don't need to give a definitive answer, just a reasonable possible answer. This kind of fine-tuning argument uses a pincer move with respect to time. Some factors make a later incarnation ideal and some factors make an earlier incarnation ideal, so the actual optimal time ends up being an empirically-determined point between temporal extrema.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In principle, an apologist might propose any number of factors on either side. My list here is simply what originally first came to mind. It's certainly not exhaustive, and it doesn't need to be. As long as there are some factors on either side then the principle has been demonstrated, albeit without a calculation of the exact empirical matter. The exact empirical calculation is also something I am precisely not interested in doing at this early stage in developing the argument.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>The great-making factors I point to include exactly those brought by the objectors and a couple of others. Great-making factors for a late incarnation include:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Verifiability of the life of Jesus. For example, crowds watched him when a few thousand years earlier only a few people may have been available.<ol><li>Twelve disciples is a peculiar number and may also reflect critical mass or fine-tuning. Twelve disciples lead to four gospels. Would Christianity have spread so well with six disciples and two gospels? Biblical Scholars would certainly be more critical of the Christian story if there had only been two gospels, and that's assuming the unlikely scenario that a similar number of Biblical Scholars would exist in such a world.</li></ol></li><li>Verifiability of the text of scripture. The activities of Jesus and the writings of scripture are surely two different considerations. Importantly, written language would need to exist.</li><li>The virality of the message of scripture.<ol><li>The mere existence of written language may contribute to integrity, but it won't contribute much to virality or spread until the written language becomes widespread and normative.</li><li>Improvements to communication and logistical improvements also help here, which occur later in history.</li><li>Finally, civilization helps here. Humans settling, forming social networks, and living with many people in relative proximity, allows a message to propagate to many people, in contrast with something like a very early appearance of Jesus to a tribe of roving hunters.</li></ol></li><li>Some kind of actual punishment for Adam and Eve.<ol><li>Here, let's just consider: Why not make Jesus the firstborn of Adam and Eve? One reason is that God wanted to carry out actual punishment throughout their lifetimes, besides the theological implications it might include having God incarnate as the son of the two people that initiated the fall of man.</li></ol></li><li>The universe implementation option of heritability.<ol><li>God could have made a universe with humans that had zero heritability across all traits.</li><li>If he did that, then zero of the sin nature, behavioral patterns, and so on, from Adam and Eve would have been spread from parent to child.</li><li>However, the concepts of parenthood, fatherhood, motherhood, childhood, family, and similar concepts would be grossly mutated in such a non-heritable universe.</li><li>God considers such concepts net goods, and perhaps considers heritability per se a good, and so created humans with heritability.</li><li>As a result of the existence of heritability, a sinless human is at least very unlikely to be born early, if such a human is even possible in principle.</li><li>Please don't label this an argument from original sin, because it's not.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Great-making factors for an early incarnation include:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Decreased human evil and suffering.</li><li>In a very early incarnation, the message of Jesus might quickly spread to a greater percentage of all humans.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>We can also consider the inverse of each great-making factor. For example, the flourishing of the message is associated with a late incarnation. Let's test the validity of this factor by considering the inverse. Would an early incarnation be associated with reduced message virality or flourishing? This seems very likely on the grounds that arguing for the integrity of the written gospel is difficult enough under present conditions, and would be easier under an appearance in the modern age.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>So, we initialize a trend over time where older stories are more difficult to preserve. This trend is plausible already, and now further consider the discontinuous increase in difficulty should Jesus have appeared before the invention of written language. In fact, we can plainly see such difficulty because the Exodus recorded in the Old Testament is purported to take place before the invention of writing, and criticisms of the historicity of the Exodus are far more widespread compared to criticisms of the historical Jesus.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>We can also speculate that some amount of time between the Old and New Testaments were required:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>In order for prophecies to become impressive. Forecasting something that occurs next week is much less interesting than forecasting an event in the far future.</li><li>For the development of a community with general corrupted tradition.<ol><li>When the law was revealed to Moses it was fresh, perfect, and holy.</li><li>Early on, religious leaders may have been afraid to edit the law as revealed. Over time, certainly by the time of Jesus, we know that many corruptions not revealed to Moses had been added into the religion and community as obligatory norms. This created an opportunity for correction that would not be available, say, the day after the law was revealed to Moses.</li><li>This situation allowed the creation of a higher good and demonstration of greater ability on the part of Jesus. For Jesus to restore a fallen community is more impressive than, say, if Jesus had been born the day after the tablets of Moses were revealed. In the latter cases, Jesus is merely the best student of a given set of rules. In the former case, Jesus has to do something far more difficult than following given rules: He has to transcend bad social rules, find the right rules, and ultimately influence his community to swap the bad ones for the good ones.</li><li>In completing 2.3, Jesus takes on a role describable as a teacher, a healer, a redeemer, and so on, rather than a mere student of Moses, which is a description that is harmonious both with the typical Christian concept of Jesus and also with someone who would be able to eliminate sin and provide eternal life.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Waiting too long, however, traps the Jews under a suboptimal set of laws and a covenant that was intended to be temporary from the beginning.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

As a review, some articles on ordinal logic are linked at the end.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>I. Reviewing the Death of Arbitrary Significance</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In 2016, the American Statistical Association (ASA) <a href=\\\"https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.YnvDLejMKHs\\\">released a statement of guidance related to p-values</a>. <a href=\\\"https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2016/03/p-values\\\">The APA took note</a> and interviewed the executive director of the ASA. Together these organizations officiated the beginning of the 'post p&lt;0.05 era.' Many individual scholars had long held this alpha threshold was arbitrary and inferior to a wide array of other measures. Finally, the world leaders in statistical analysis agreed.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>In the case of economics, for example, economic importance is far more meaningful, which is to say actually meaningful. Now, in theory, the journals would be forced to accept analysis on those grounds. In practice, this announcement was largely ignored. Standard significance levels continued to be reported. Journals continued to reject findings due to low significance, label results with a p-value less significant than 0.1 as an underpowered, non-serious study, and so on, even continuing to grossly conflate significance and importance. Scholars continued to abuse statistics with statements like \\\"we find no evidence that X\\\" because results around X were \\\"insignificant\\\" at some arbitrarily grounded threshold.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I, on the other hand, had been ahead of this curve, dealing with axiomatically-grounded thresholds using ordinal logic as early as 2014, when I published \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/quantified-ordinal-modelling-action/\\\">Quantified Ordinal Modelling of Action</a>\\\" here on this blog. I also wrote many other articles including applications of this framework. See the last section of this article for a collection of links reviewing ordinal logic.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>It is an embarrassment to the natural sciences that it took until 2019 for biology to recognize this issue, with <a href=\\\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0174\\\">an announcement in The Royal Society</a> that \\\"The reign of the p-value is over\\\" and a discussion in Nature about \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00874-8\\\">It’s time to talk about ditching statistical significance</a>\\\" with the subtitle \\\"Looking beyond a much used and abused measure would make science harder, but better.\\\" Nature seems to admit that arbitrary significance is attractive in part simply because it is easy, at the cost of being less correct. As of today, essentially every leading body of scholars is agreed with this view, yet much research continues to be rejected in the journals along such lines, even in the fields of psychology and economics, which were early-comers to this lens. My sense of current industry is at least similarly dismal on average.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>II. A Review of Ordinal Computation, and Ordinal Logic as a Complexity Guard</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>An ordinal transpose of the plain-language statement \\\"A is probable\\\" may be rendered as p(A) > 0.5. Under specific yet common conditions we may also state p(A) > p(A').</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>When computing a point estimate for p(A), we have relatively low resolution on the simple statement that \\\"A is probable.\\\" Given the range from 0.5 to 1, a point estimate of 0.75 is optimal by simple error minimization.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Now consider that p(B) is \\\"very probable,\\\" which we translate to mean p(B) > p(A) | p(A) > 0.5. Now the estimable range for p(B) is from 0.75 to 1 and the point estimate becomes 0.875. This can be described as \\\"probable with two degrees of ordinal confidence.\\\" Degrees of confidence are usefully applied in comparisons of confidence and can also be applied within a bayesian framework to produce logically-grounded bayesian inputs and computations.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Now, suppose that I think the true probability is greater than 0.75 but less than 0.875. I take the average and obtain 0.8125. Note that 1-.5^2.5 ~= 0.8232, so the stepped ordinal logic process is not isomorphic to an expression of the power of two. An expression of the power of two is quite parsimonies, but the ordinal expression becomes verbose. The ordinal expression of \\\"between 0.75 and 0.875\\\" is like \\\"this event is less than very probable but more than simply probable.\\\" Basically, we are trying to describe the step-wise traversal of a binary probability tree using plain language. Ordinal expression creates a useful complexity check by asking, \\\"Do you really have a sufficient number of reasons to make this number of moves? Is your resolution of estimation logically justified?\\\"</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>III. Epsilon-Likelihood and Ordinal Logic</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Bryan Caplan is one who has often raised the issue of translating from plain language to a proper statistical estimate. <a href=\\\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2017/08/tristans_tetloc.html\\\">Tristan Caplan's Tetlockian Glossary</a> is a great example of such a discussion. Ordinal logic provides a correct approach for solving this, but the language can become strange. Epsilon-likelihood is valuable in one respect as a means of solving this language problem.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Consider that the statement p(A) > 0.5 can be re-written with no loss of generality as p(A) = 0.5+I+e, where I is a non-negative integer and e is <a href=\\\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Epsilon.html\\\">epsilon</a>. If we want to be extra picky then we can stipulate that e is a finite transform or positive finite approximation of epsilon, being arbitrarily small, but never reaching the limit of zero. This pickiness is fair enough because it is true that some event cannot be correctly called probable when the likelihood is at exactly 0.5.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>What does this epsilon concept gain us? Basically just one thing as far as I can see at the moment: A convenient, parsimonious way to distinguish events that are probable with an expected point estimate near even odds from the ordinary point estimate, which would be substantially higher at about 0.75 without further qualification.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>As examples, consider the expressions \\\"epsilon likelihood,\\\" \\\"probable with zero degrees of confidence,\\\" and \\\"probable with epsilon confidence\\\" as shorthand for ~0%, ~50%, and ~50%, respectively.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>IV. A Heuristic Transpose of Alpha Norms into Ordinal Logic</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Ordinal logic tells us that p &lt; 0.5 means some coefficient is more likely to exist rather than to not exist. Put another way, the true effect is probably closer to the given estimate rather than zero. Put a third way, eliminating the factor is expected to decrease information contained in the model (some exceptions if the factor is perfectly partialled and similar edge cases).</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Importance analysis tells us that in some cases p > 0.5 could still be interesting if a factor has a large magnitude, robustness across specifications, or promise for feasible application in the real world. We should worry about statistical credibility at this point and seek to gather more samples or otherwise reduce p to get a \\\"probably not wrong\\\" estimate, but we may not want to throw out the factor altogether. Of course, the same is true if we have theoretical reason to case about the factor. With those exceptions, I tend to quickly throw out variables with p > 0.5 simply because of the level of effort to parse out true effects, robustness test, and so on. The return on investment to research time often becomes a net loss with such factors.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Ordinal logic tells us about three more interesting cases outside of traditional norms, and after that we will see that it overlaps with traditional normal analysis.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>p-value between 0.25 and 0.5 would be considered nonexistent by traditional p-value analysis, ordinal analysis says they are unlikely with less than one degree of confidence. Maybe worth further exploration but not strong enough to assert ordinal unlikeliness. A risk-averse scholar might rationally buffer against accepting these.</li><li>0.125 &lt; p-value &lt; .25 is considered unlikely and an ordinal model would seek to keep these while traditional analysis would reject them. Notice that these factors empirically do typically contribute to information criterion and adjusted r-squared improvements.</li><li>Traditional analysis would arbitrarily become interested at p-value &lt; 0.1, but with ordinal analysis I think we have a compelling reason to accept p-value &lt; 0.125 as strong. These are events that are unlikely with more than two degrees of confidence.</li><li>Unlikely with three degrees of confidence evaluates to p &lt; (0.5^4 = 0.0625) and so becomes compatible with the traditional 0.1 cutoff.</li><li>Five degrees = 0.5^6 ~= 0.03, compatible with traditional 0.05.</li><li>Six degrees = 0.5^7 ~= 0.0078, compatible with traditional 0.01.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Notice that these heuristic mappings also help identify interesting qualitative studies. If a study raises four to six reasons for outcome X, this maps on well to something that should establish a traditionally compelling case. That, of course, assumes no reasons found for outcome X', which would need to be further accounted for, similar to what we see in bayesian analysis, and potentially directly leveraging modified bayesian math.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>IV.

The video stated that \\\"there are very few things that are not justifiable when it comes to protesting climate change because [climate change] will lead to millions of people dying.\\\" I replied that some economists think global warming will lead to an increase in farmable and habitable land, so it's not clear that we can causally attribute any net deaths, let alone millions, to climate change.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>If we ignore the important qualification of \\\"net\\\" on deaths, then yes, there are many studies linking climate change to a variety of death counts in a variety of ways. <a href=\\\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-related-deaths\\\">One article from the EPA</a> identifies \\\"more than 1,300 deaths per year in the United States are due to extreme heat\\\" and <a href=\\\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-cold-related-deaths\\\">another article</a> from the EPA states that \\\"more than 19,000 Americans have died from cold-related causes since 1979.\\\" At the global level, the World Health Organization forecasted that \\\"Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition [and other reasons].\\\"</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>These numbers are serious and tragic, but they pale in comparison to current and future death counts directly attributable to a weakened economy. In addition to an outright loss in face-value comparison, the analyses from the EPA and the WHO have additional issues:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Some researchers indicate that nutrition per capita could improve due to global warming. It's not an accurate comparison to count nutrition harm without also counting nutrition gains.<ol><li>As an example, <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euL39f1kins\\\">David Friedman here mentions</a> that IPCC estimates of possible global warming would be associated with a 20-30% increase in crop yield, the benefit of which is ignored in standard analyses like the WHO analysis.</li><li>Policy interventions designed to solve climate change have negative side effects on the economy and so contribute to malnutrition by reducing incomes, raising prices, reducing innovation, and so on. Malnutrition doesn't solely result from climate change, it also results from trying to prevent climate change. Counting malnutrition in one case and not comparing it against malnutrition in the other case is not an accurate counterfactual analysis. It results in an overestimation of the gains from policy.</li></ol></li><li>IPCC estimates on long-term global warming potential tend to be revised toward zero over time. Initial estimates tend to be more fantastic than the realized values and later estimates. Similarly, long-range forecasting from WHO may exaggerate.</li><li>Government bodies generally are subject to regulatory capture, all sorts of negative biases documented in the public choice literature, and particularly tend to favor results that would grow the sizes of government and their own agencies. In the case of climate change, that is, they would be expected to exaggerate the would-be state of the world in the absence of intervention and ignore autonomous solutions from the free market.</li><li>Substantial amelioration of climate change has already occurred on the market. The idea that climate change is a problem and therefore destruction of art, private property, and government intervention are automatically optimal solutions is absurd. Government policy in general is a failure, why would climate regulation be a special case?</li><li>In the same link provided above, David Friedman also notes that net deaths from extreme temperatures should decrease in the case of global warming because deaths from cold are more numerous and they would be less common in a warm world.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Contrast those tiny numbers with the massive number of individuals that die monthly, not annually, due to poverty and related conditions. <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3855327/\\\">Suicide, homicide</a>, starvation, war, mental illness, developmental issues, reduced medical care, inability to research new medical advances, and many other issues are directly attributable to a stagnated economy.

In short: This study vastly underestimates the death count attributable to a weakened economy.</li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Thinking beyond simplistic ideas of minimizing carbon emissions or maximizing single measures of any kind leads us to realize an evergreen truth of policy, engineering, and economics: Choices involve tradeoffs. In turn, we need to look at specific choices to understand the specific tradeoffs. In particular: Even a meager 5% reduction in GDP seems to be far more harmful than the problems climate change would introduce by 2050. So we must ask: Do particular plans to mitigate climate change cost more or less than 5% of GDP?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>One answer: The market is already voluntarily seeking to reduce climate change at a cost of zero to the taxpayer. That is, without policy intervention. <a href=\\\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions\\\">According to the EPA</a>, \\\"U.S. greenhouse gas emissions decreased from 2019 to 2020 by 9 percent,\\\" so our contribution is already declining with no further action needed. Now consider a particular policy on the current stage of debate in the US: AOC's Green New Deal. This proposal <a href=\\\"http://factcheck.org/2019/03/how-much-will-the-green-new-deal-cost/\\\">has cost estimates between 6.6 and 93 trillion dollars</a>. According to the BEA, the nominal GDP in 2020 was $20.94 trillion, making AOC's bill conservatively in excess of 25% of GDP. Demonstrably dangerous, and not demonstrably able to impact global climate change trends over the period from 2030 to 2050 and beyond.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I am interested in contemplative strategies in particular because these can be undertaken during meditation and may lead to an improvement in emotional control that can be leveraged for the purposes of enhanced emotional learning and enhanced performance for other activities. This article has two sections beginning with preparatory guidance and concluding with the specific five strategies.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I. Preparatory Guidance</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>To prepare for these contemplative exercises, begin with a standard relaxation meditation. Guided or unguided forms can both work. Follow normal meditative practices including the use of a clean and quiet setting with dim lighting. Use a quiet setting. Total silence, low-level natural background noise, or quiet instrumental music may all work. Experiment to find what works best for you. For music, consider using a repeated and simple progression to minimize distraction. Minimize distractions by ensuring your phone and other noise-emitting, light-emitting, or similar objects are not within sight or earshot. Try to wear relaxed clothing, avoid wearing a hat, remove glasses or contacts, and put yourself in a generally comfortable situation including your posture and the room temperature.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Start with a standard meditative session leveraging relaxation techniques such as closing the eyes and proceeding to move intentional focus throughout muscle groups, expressing a conscious will to relax those groups one by one, with consistent and slow breathing through the nose.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>During this time you should attempt to clear your mind by focusing on the physical space in your current vicinity. Most people cannot wilfully repress the mind from wandering, wondering, imagining, or recalling, but indirect repression can be achieved by intentional occupation. So, we call this \\\"clearing the mind,\\\" but in fact, you will be sharply focused on the current vicinity, the sounds in the current vicinity, and the pattern of your own breath.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>You will be able to notice physical sensations that usually go undetected because you are explicitly and slowly probing your entire physical body for sensations. Those sensations may be in your limbs or in your brain. You may notice, for example, that you have had a background headache that you hadn't been paying attention to. Try to intentionally relax your eyes, eyebrows, nose, ears, and even the brain itself if possible to see if this helps. You can also try physically massaging your forehead, palms, and so on to see if that helps.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>If you are unable to achieve relaxation and aches persist, consider canceling the emotional practice and ending the session early to rest or do whatever would normally be appropriate. Avoid forcing yourself into an emotional state when you have been unable to relax, because this may unintentionally trigger feelings of anxiety, frustration, or other emotions, and create a negative reinforcement with uncontrolled emotion. Expect that progress will be made as long as you are able to carry out emotional practices three or more times each week, and don't worry about missing one or even several days each week. If you have tried the practice for multiple weeks and have not been able to succeed even once, consider seeking external help.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Experiment with timing. If you can achieve relaxation in 10-15 minutes, you may also be able to achieve emotional sensitivity within a 30-minute session. If you need 20 minutes or more for relaxation, don't count on being able to achieve emotional sensitivity in less time than relaxation required. It often takes more time, although this of course varies by person.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Once relaxation has been achieved, direct your attention to a stable location in space. Let's just focus on the tip of your nose simply for convenience and the sake of consistency. After a few seconds of stable focus on the nose, begin a mental transition to emotional contemplation.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>II. The Five Contemplative Strategies</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>When ready, here are some contemplative strategies:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Phantom anger: Construct a logical situation in which you would find yourself properly and justly angry. Perhaps you witness physical violence on an innocent. Now, visualize that logical situation taking place with a specific character. Imagine what they would do and say. Try to imagine the sound of the words. Pay attention to whether you feel a physical sense of anger, blood pressure, or breath change as you imagine your anger at this phantom character.</li><li>Phantom empathetic sadness: Construct a logical situation in which you would find yourself deeply sad by empathetic means. For example, you are on a walk one day and you find an injured child alone by a road and they are crying. Imagine looking at them and physically empathizing with the pain, then making eye contact with them. Imagine how they react to your presence, whether they say anything, and, if so, in what tone of voice. Imagine a deep feeling of sadness in response to this situation, and pay attention to whether you experience any associated physical sensations, such as a change in facial expression or the pressure of tears beginning to well up in your eyes.</li><li>Memorial emotion: Whether anger, sadness, happiness, peace, stress, or any other emotion; draw on actual memories instead of a phantom situation. Replay the memory, paying attention to sensory details such as visual and audio details, even smells. After recalling the scene, characters, and sensations, focus on the emotions you felt. Imagine time slowing down so that you can remain in each emotional state, 1-by-1, for several seconds each. Notice whether you feel any physical sensations, changes in breathing, changes in blood pressure, addition or removal of headaches, or changes in muscular tension as you cycle through the mental experience of one or more emotions.</li><li>Hypothetical emotion: Similar to memorial emotion, but instead of recalling a real past event, imagine a future situation that you believe could actually take place. Anticipate a real upcoming event, goal, or plan. Imagine it going well or not well for various reasons. Imagine situations that surprise or do not surprise you. Cycle through them slowly, not rapidly. Pick one emotion at a time and play with it for at least thirty seconds. In those thirty seconds, Imagine that this hypothetical situation takes place in a way that makes you feel the emotion in question. Notice whether this evokes an emotional response and whether this causes you to become repulsed by the hypothetical situation or attracted to it and possibly excited about it.</li><li>Prop meditation: Don't do this too often as props can distract from meditation, but give it a shot and see how it goes, particularly if you are a sentimental person with specific items that have an emotional meaning to you. With your eyes closed, hold the item in your hands. Visualize the item although your eyes remain closed. Visualize the situation the item relates to emotionally, and try to recall the related scene, characters, and emotions. Slowly reimagine the scene and the emotions, noticing any physical changes that go along with your recollection.</li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Over the course of several emotional meditative sessions, notice whether your ability to regulate emotions seems to increase, accounting for external factors like the amount of sleep, stress, and nutrition surrounding each session. As you find yourself increasingly able to self-trigger, try to channel or apply this emotion toward a concrete goal, and over time keep a mental list of your successes that were aided by emotion, as they can be used for additional meditative practice.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>To end on a humorous note - need an example of emotional-fueled concrete action? Look no further than a famous enraged rant from Dave Ramsey about financial behavior!</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:embed {\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMaVwLGpWrI\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"video\\\",\\\"providerNameSlug\\\":\\\"youtube\\\",\\\"responsive\\\":true,\\\"className\\\":\\\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\\"} -->\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\\">\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMaVwLGpWrI\\n</div></figure>\\n<!-- /wp:embed -->",

    "title": "Panpsychism and Classical Theism",
    "date": "2023-10-14",
    "author": "John Vandivier",
    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>If any being possesses omniscience, then panpsychism of a kind is true. Why, then, is panpsychism often discussed as unusual, niche, or an alternative to Christianity?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Here are two ways in which a special kinds of panpsychism can be distinguished from Christianity:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:list {\\\"ordered\\\":true} -->\\n<ol><li>Some panpsychists will argue that material has consciousness. This direction of relation seems to contrast with the Christian story where agency is prior to creation.<ol><li>I've seen this defended with a kind of quasi-evolutionary or behavioral-emergentist argument that basically goes as follows: Humans are intelligent and aware of many qualia such as colors, taste, smell, and so on. Animals are so to a lesser extent, plants to a lesser extent, and microbiota to a lesser extent. So, conciousness follows the evolutionary path, and therefore we need not expect conciousness absent material.</li><li>Several problems come from this view. I'll discuss three. First, evolution itself already has problems in the origin of biological life. The panpsychist will face similar problems to the degree that they lean on this story. Conciousenss in plants, animals, and organisms is far more plausible than conciousness in rocks, molecules, atoms, and quarks.</li><li>Second, some animals aware of qualia that aren't observable to humans, and indeed some plants and microbiota. So it's not clear that the growth in degree of conciousness tracks the evolutionary story very well. Why do we think the visual or scent experience of a fly is related to a conciousness of a lower degree? It seems to reduce down to intuition pumping on evolution or a red herring where intelligence rather than qualia is the key indicator.</li><li>Third is the radio theory of consciousness. See more details about what this is at the end of the article. Under this theory, a mind might be highly capable before any communication device exists for it, and the communication device might evolve independently. The observational-behavioral result would seem equivalent: An animal behaves subject to the constraints of their bodies, but their mind is not obviously impuned. How does the panpsychist discriminate between this theory and the evolutionary account which would claim that degrees of conciousness are growing over time? I think the pure panpsychist should be happy to grant that their theory would be compatible with either option.</li></ol></li><li>Some panpsychists will argue that the consciousness associated with various materials is distinct, in contrast to the meme of omniscience as panpsychism, which would hold that at least one consciousness permeates all material.<ol><li>The problem here is both a lack of demonstration and a double standard: The panpsychist only directly observe their own experience, and yet they do not posit other humans are philosophical zombies. So, they grant that all people have consciousness without direct observation, they grant consciousness of rocks and base molecules without observation, and yet they want to reject the possibility of omniscience as consciousness without direct observation.<ol><li>I think the lurking and dubious assumption in this approach to panpsychism is a rejection of multiple layers of consciousnesses with respect to a single material region. There can be no singular omniscient consciousness, they suppose, because my material brain is already associated with my own consciousness, so it cannot also be used by another consciousness. This is actually a powerful lurking claim made with no evidence, and it seems to run into various issues despite having various advantages. Four issues include:<ol><li>Multiple personality disorder</li><li>The concepts of social or cultural conciousness, or other concepts of aggregate agency and conciousness</li><li>Arguments for omniscience</li><li>The burden of proof for a complicated emergence of consciousness loss or transfer on the part of material under some conditions. That is, if my brain were decomposed into molecules the panpsychist would hold that they are each conscious. When they are combined, this camp of panpsychist seems to say that their original state isn't merely accompanied by a new aggregate consciousness, but further, the aggregate consciousness displaces the prior lower consciousness of the individual parts. I have seen no demonstration of this sort of thing and it is a rather advanced claim to make with no evidence. The null hypothesis would be: We can see the human consciousness and we believe in the innate primitive consciousnesses, so let's hypothesize that they all exist rather than supposing some additional process by which the lower consciousnesses cease.</li></ol></li><li>I suppose there is an exception to the accusation of double standard within this group if a panpsychist of this kind were to argue that their consciousness alone is real and it permeates all material; I've never met such a self-deifying solipsist-panpsychist, and I think that view can be easily shown as absurd.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>\\n<!-- /wp:list -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>It is important to note that either of these camps involves many other assumptions compared to panpsychism per se. In order to defend mere panpsychism, it would be advantageous to minimize the number of assumptions, commitments, theses, and assertions. If you are seeking to defend panpsychism, why not embrace Christianity as an option?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:separator -->\\n<hr class=\\\"wp-block-separator\\\"/>\\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>A chat with GPT-4 about the Radio Theory of Consciousness:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>My Prompt:<br>There is a theory in the philosophy of mind that makes an analogy between human minds and radios or transmitters. In this theory, a person with a damaged brain might have a damaged ability to communicate between mind and body. What is this theory called, or what are some academic references?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>ChatGPT Response:<br>The theory you're referring to is often known as the \\\"Radio Theory of Consciousness\\\" or the \\\"Transmission Theory of Consciousness.\\\" The central idea is that the brain acts like a radio, \\\"tuning\\\" into consciousness rather than producing it. Just as a broken radio might fail to tune into a radio station but doesn't negate the existence of the broadcast signal, damage to the brain might impede conscious experience without proving that the brain is the source of consciousness itself.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>One of the most famous proponents of a view like this was the psychologist and philosopher William James. He suggested that the brain might act as a filter or transmitter for consciousness, rather than its originator. Similarly, the philosopher and parapsychologist Frederic W. H. Myers proposed a similar idea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where he likened the brain to a transmitter of consciousness.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>More recently, scholars such as David Chalmers have delved into the \\\"hard problem of consciousness,\\\" though Chalmers doesn't endorse the transmission theory per se. Nonetheless, discussions around the hard problem highlight the complexities and challenges inherent in understanding the relationship between the brain and consciousness.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>If you want to read more about these ideas, consider the following references:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>James, William. \\\"The Principles of Psychology.\\\" 1890.<br>Myers, Frederic W. H. \\\"Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death.\\\" 1903.<br>Kelly, Edward F., et al. \\\"Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century.\\\" 2007. This book looks at a range of phenomena that challenge the mainstream neuroscientific view of consciousness and revisits ideas similar to the transmission theory.<br>Keep in mind, however, that the majority of neuroscientists and philosophers of mind today believe that consciousness arises from brain activity. The transmission theory is more of a fringe view, but it remains an intriguing concept in the broader discussion of the nature of consciousness.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
